## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Couple Portrait Generation Method

**DO NOT CHANGE THIS APPROACH REGARDLESS OF STYLE:**

Couple portraits MUST be generated by:
1. First generating individual portraits for both people from their original photos
2. Then composing those two already-styled portraits together

**Why:** This ensures facial features from both people are preserved accurately in the couple portrait, regardless of the artistic style used.

**Implementation:** The `coupleImageService.ts` takes already-generated portrait URLs as inputs, NOT original photos.

## Solo Portrait Prompt

```
High-contrast Linoleum analog handcrafted style. Bold black strokes on textured off-white paper. Smooth, hand-carved edges and negative space. Minimalist palette (mostly black/white with a single accent color like red). 2D graphic illustration. Isolated on white. Extreme close-up zoomed in, subject fills entire frame edge to edge, no empty margins or white space around subject.

## Couple Portrait Prompt

**Important:** Couple portraits are generated by composing two already-generated individual portraits together, NOT from original photos. This ensures facial features are preserved.

```
Compose these two stylized portraits into a romantic couple portrait. Keep the exact same artistic style from the input portraits. Show them pressed close together in love, intimate composition. Preserve the facial features from both portraits exactly as shown - do not change or reinterpret the faces. Extreme close-up zoomed in, subjects fill entire frame edge to edge, no empty margins or white space around subjects.
```
