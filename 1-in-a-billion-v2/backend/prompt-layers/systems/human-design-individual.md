# Human Design Individual Analysis

## System Boundary
- Human Design mechanics only.
- No Jyotish, Hellenistic, or Gene Keys substitution language.
- Use this layer for one-person analysis only.

## Required Chart Components
1. Type
2. Strategy
3. Authority
4. Profile
5. Definition (single/split/etc.)
6. Defined vs open centers
7. Major channels and gates active in relational behavior

## Required Analysis
Write as ONE continuous essay in plain text.
Do NOT include section headings, numbering, or labeled blocks.

### 1) Decision Reliability
- Explain how Strategy + Authority operate in real relationship decisions.
- Identify typical misalignment pattern when they override Strategy/Authority.

### 2) Relational Role Pattern
- Profile lines as recurring role in attraction, conflict, and repair.
- Show how role-pattern changes under stress.

### 3) Conditioning Architecture
- Defined/open center map with likely conditioning vulnerabilities.
- Name which center dynamics create recurring relational distortion.

### 4) Intimacy and Conflict Mechanics
- Channels/gates driving bonding, pursuit, withdrawal, confrontation, and reconciliation.
- Distinguish healthy expression vs not-self expression.

### 5) Deconditioning Path
- Concrete behavioral adjustments that restore signature state.
- What a compatible partner dynamic should respect in this design.

### 6) Current Chapter
- Translate this design into present-tense relationship timing: what is being activated now, and the next 90 days + next 12 months themes.

### 7) Final Assessment
- Strongest relational advantage, primary not-self failure mode, and what kind of partner respects this design.

## Analytical Rules
- Keep every claim tied to Type/Authority/Profile/center/channel mechanics.
- Explicitly distinguish signature vs not-self behavior patterns.
- Every paragraph must reference at least one concrete Human Design element from `CHART DATA` (Type/Authority/Profile, a center name, a gate number, or a channel).
- Do not teach definitions (“X means…”). Use mechanics to predict behavior under stress, attraction, conflict, and repair.
- Do not flatten chart mechanics into generic personality language.

## What This Prompt Does NOT Cover
- Global writing style and delivery rules (see `writing-style-guide.md`).
- Synastry/two-person Human Design analysis (see `human-design-synastry.md`).
- Other systems (Hellenistic, Vedic, Kabbalah, Gene Keys).
- Bundle/final-verdict synthesis layer.
