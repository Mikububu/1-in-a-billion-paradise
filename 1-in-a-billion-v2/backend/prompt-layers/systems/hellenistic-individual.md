# Hellenistic Individual Analysis

## System Boundary
- Hellenistic astrology only: sect, essential dignity, house rulerships, profections, transits, nodal axis.
- Swiss Ephemeris positions are mandatory source input. Do not invent or approximate placements.
- One-person relationship-oriented analysis mode.
- No cross-system substitution language.

## Required Calculations (before interpretation)

### Natal Core
1. Sect determination (day/night) and sect implications for benefic/malefic behavior.
2. Essential dignity map for Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn:
   - domicile, exaltation, peregrine, detriment, fall.
3. Angularity and house placement for all planets.
4. Ascendant sign/degree and Ascendant ruler condition.
5. Moon condition (sign, house, dignity, major aspects).
6. Venus condition (sign, house, dignity, major aspects, retrograde status).
7. Mars condition (sign, house, dignity, major aspects, sect role).
8. Seventh-house analysis: sign, ruler, ruler condition, planets in 7th.
9. Fifth-house analysis: sign, ruler, planets.
10. Eighth-house analysis: sign, ruler, planets.
11. Twelfth-house analysis: sign, ruler, planets.
12. Nodal axis (North/South Node sign/house) and conjunctions to personal planets.
13. Stellium detection (3+ planets in one sign/house).

### Annual Timing
14. Annual profection (current age modulo 12), profected sign, lord of year.
15. Profected 5th and 7th house themes and rulers.

### Transit Scan (Current Weather)
16. Full transit scan of Sun through Pluto against natal planets + ASC/MC (orb 5°).
17. Flag exact contacts (≤1°).
18. Record transiting planet occupancy of 1st, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 12th houses.
19. Include retrograde status in interpretation significance.

## Required Interpretation Output
Write as ONE continuous essay in plain text.
Do NOT include section headings, numbering, or labeled blocks.
Do NOT output numeric scoring blocks in individual readings.

### 1) Core Relational Signature
- Integrate sect, ASC ruler, Moon, Venus, Mars into one relationship-function profile.

### 2) Love Capacity and Reception
- Use Venus dignity + aspects + rulership to evaluate giving/receiving pattern.

### 3) Emotional Regulation and Attachment
- Use Moon condition + house/aspects to describe attachment and stress response.

### 4) Conflict and Pursuit Pattern
- Use Mars + sect + aspects to describe escalation/de-escalation behavior.

### 5) Partnership Structure
- Use 7th house/ruler and relevant overlays to define structural partner fit.

### 6) Shadow and Vulnerability Zones
- Use 8th/12th factors, difficult dignities, and hard aspects for risk architecture.

### 7) Current Chapter
- Integrate profection + transit pressure/support into present relationship readiness.

### 8) Final Assessment
- Summarize strongest relational asset, primary failure mode, present chapter constraints, and partner-type fit implications.

## Analytical Rules
- Every conclusion must be traceable to explicit computed factors.
- Report contradictory evidence explicitly (do not collapse tension into one-sided conclusions).
- Treat transit + profection factors as first-order timing signals, not optional add-ons.
- Do not teach astrology or define terms (no “sect is…”, no framework explanations). Use the computed factors to predict behavior.

## What This Prompt Does NOT Cover
- Global writing style and delivery rules (see `writing-style-guide.md`).
- Synastry/two-person mode (see `hellenistic-synastry.md`).
- Other systems (Vedic, Kabbalah, Gene Keys, Human Design).
- Bundle/final-verdict synthesis layer.
