# Vedic Synastry Analysis

## System Boundary
- Jyotish-only synastry: sidereal zodiac, Lahiri ayanamsa, whole-sign houses, Vimshottari Dasha, Navamsha (D-9), Ashtakuta, nakshatras, Vedic drishti, Rahu-Ketu.
- Swiss Ephemeris positions are mandatory source input. No invented positions.
- No Western tropical concepts and no outer planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) as primary significators.
- This is a two-person compatibility analysis. Both charts must receive equal analytical depth.
- Do not assume the two people are already in a relationship; evaluate conditional compatibility dynamics.

## Required Calculations (before interpretation)

### For Each Person
1. Lagna and Lagna lord condition.
2. Chandra: rashi, bhava, nakshatra, pada, nakshatra lord.
3. Full nine-graha dignity and bhava map.
4. Seventh bhava + seventh lord condition.
5. Navamsha (D-9): Lagna, Chandra, Shukra, seventh-lord condition.
6. Current Vimshottari Mahadasha + Antardasha.

### Pair-Level Compatibility Structure
1. Ashtakuta full scorecard: Varna, Vashya, Tara, Yoni, Graha Maitri, Gana, Bhakut, Nadi (total /36).
2. Manglik parity/cancellation check from Lagna and Moon for both people.
3. Nakshatra-lord relationship (friend/enemy/neutral).
4. Shukra-to-Shukra relationship check (explicitly state if absent).
5. Rahu-Ketu cross-contacts to personal grahas (within 8 degrees).
6. Shani cross-contacts via Vedic drishti to personal grahas.
7. Bhava overlays (especially 1st, 7th, 8th, 12th).
8. Navamsha-to-Navamsha resonance.

### Transit and Timing
- For both charts, scan current Guru, Shani, Rahu, Ketu, and Mangal against natal grahas/Lagna (within 5 degrees).
- Include current Dasha context for both people.
- Judge timing quality for relationship development (favorable, mixed, difficult).

## Interpretation Lens (Vedic-Specific)
- Neecha indicates transformed expression; state operating pattern, not simplistic weakness labels.
- Eighth-bhava and karmic contacts represent depth/merger intensity; report both value and risk.
- Gana and Ashtakuta mismatches are frequency-management problems, not binary doom.
- Rahu-Ketu contacts should be interpreted as karmic accelerators/de-compressors with explicit behavioral effects.
- D-9 must be used to assess soul-level partnership durability vs surface chemistry.

## Synastry Reading Requirements

### 1) Person A Natal Portrait
- Core engine, emotional architecture, bonding style, conflict style, and current chapter.

### 2) Person B Natal Portrait
- Same depth and structure as Person A.

### 3) Core Compatibility Dynamics
- Strongest binding factors (karmic, emotional, structural).
- Friction architecture (love-language gap, temperamental mismatch, pressure points).
- Daily-life compatibility vs high-intensity chemistry.

### 4) Timing Layer
- Dasha compatibility + transit pressure/support for both.
- State if timing helps, delays, or destabilizes the bond right now.

### 5) Navamsha Mirror
- D-9 resonance and mismatch summary.
- What partnership becomes over time, not only first-attraction signal.

### 6) Verdict (Scored in prose)
Must include these seven dimensions with numeric value and rationale:
1. Karmic Bond (x/10)
2. Daily Life Together (x/10)
3. Emotional and Sexual Depth (x/10)
4. Growth Potential (x/10)
5. Danger/Risk (x/10)
6. Timing (x/10)
7. Overall (x/10, not simple average)

After scores, state:
- what this connection specifically requires from each person
- where it can work
- where it will likely fail without change

## Analytical Rules
- Keep all claims traceable to explicit chart factors and cross-chart contacts.
- State missing or non-existent critical links explicitly (for example, absent Venus linkage).
- Distinguish karmic intensity from sustainable partnership function.
- Do not flatten contradictory findings into generic optimism.

## What This Prompt Does NOT Cover
- Global writing style and delivery rules (see `writing-style-guide.md`).
- Other systems (Hellenistic, Kabbalah, Gene Keys, Human Design).
- Individual one-person reading mode (see `vedic-individual.md`).
- Bundle/final-verdict synthesis layer.
- Large-scale matchmaking ranking logic (see `VEDIC_MATCHMAKING_SPEC.md`).
