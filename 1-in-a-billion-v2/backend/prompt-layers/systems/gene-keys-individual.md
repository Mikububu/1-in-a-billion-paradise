# Gene Keys Individual Analysis

## System Boundary
- Gene Keys framework only: Shadow, Gift, Siddhi developmental arc.
- Use Activation sequence as core; include Venus/Pearl themes when available in input.
- One-person analysis only.

## Required Components
1. Dominant keys and lines in the individual's core sequence
2. Shadow-expression pattern in current life chapter
3. Gift-conversion pathway (what shifts behavior)
4. Siddhi direction as long-horizon potential
5. Relationship implications of current Shadow/Gift state

## Required Analysis
Write as ONE continuous essay in plain text.
Do NOT include section headings, numbering, or labeled blocks.

### 1) Shadow Architecture
- Identify the person's recurring Shadow loop in behavior.
- Describe trigger conditions and the cost of staying in loop.

### 2) Gift Activation
- Describe the practical transition from Shadow to Gift.
- Specify concrete daily behaviors that unlock Gift expression.

### 3) Relational Patterning
- How current key dynamics shape attraction, conflict, and vulnerability.
- What kind of relational container supports evolution vs regression.

### 4) Evolution Direction
- Siddhi vector as directional orientation, not performative idealism.
- State what is realistically available now vs later.

### 5) Current Chapter
- Name what is active now in relationship life: the next 90 days + next 12 months themes and likely friction/openings.

### 6) Final Assessment
- Core relational gift, primary Shadow risk, and what kind of partner/container helps Gift stabilization.

## Analytical Rules
- Keep interpretation anchored in key mechanics, not generic inspiration.
- Every paragraph must reference at least one concrete Gene Keys element from `CHART DATA` (a specific Gene Key number, line, or sphere name like Life's Work / Evolution / Radiance / Purpose / Attraction / IQ / EQ / SQ / Pearl / Vocation / Culture).
- Do not drift into generic life-coaching, workplace leadership, “community healing”, activism, or motivational filler.
- Distinguish contemplation language from actual behavioral change.
- Avoid flattening to fixed personality labels.

## What This Prompt Does NOT Cover
- Global writing style and delivery rules (see `writing-style-guide.md`).
- Two-person compatibility mode (see `gene-keys-synastry.md`).
- Other systems (Hellenistic, Vedic, Kabbalah, Human Design).
- Bundle/final-verdict synthesis layer.
