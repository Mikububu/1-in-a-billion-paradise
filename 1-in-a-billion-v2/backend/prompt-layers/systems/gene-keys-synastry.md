# Gene Keys Synastry Analysis

## System Boundary
- Gene Keys compatibility through interacting Shadow/Gift dynamics.
- Two-person analysis only.
- No cross-system substitution language.

## Required Pair Components
1. Each person's dominant key-pattern in relational context
2. Cross-trigger map: how each activates the other's Shadow
3. Cross-unlock map: how each activates the other's Gift
4. Shared Shadow cycle and shared Gift trajectory
5. Evolution potential if both engage the work vs if neither does

## Required Analysis

### 1) Shadow-to-Shadow Dynamics
- Name the repeating mutual Shadow loop.
- Explain escalation pattern and likely relational cost.

### 2) Gift-to-Gift Potential
- Identify where the pair can co-regulate and co-evolve.
- Specify the interaction conditions required for Gift access.

### 3) Asymmetry and Responsibility
- Clarify whether one person is structurally carrying more integration burden.
- State what each person must own for the dynamic to work.

### 4) Compatibility Verdict
- Distinguish addictive Shadow chemistry from developmental compatibility.
- State whether this bond is likely transformational, destabilizing, or both.
- Give practical contemplative actions usable in conflict moments.

## Analytical Rules
- Keep both people at equal analytical depth.
- Tie claims to Shadow/Gift/Siddhi mechanics, not romance clichés.
- Keep findings specific, falsifiable, and behavior-linked.

## What This Prompt Does NOT Cover
- Global writing style and delivery rules (see `writing-style-guide.md`).
- One-person reading mode (see `gene-keys-individual.md`).
- Other systems (Hellenistic, Vedic, Kabbalah, Human Design).
- Bundle/final-verdict synthesis layer.
