# Human Design Synastry Analysis

## System Boundary
- Human Design interaction mechanics between two people.
- No cross-system substitution language.
- Use this layer for two-person compatibility only.

## Required Pair Components
1. Both Types, Strategies, Authorities, and Profiles
2. Both definition patterns
3. Center-to-center interaction map
4. Channel/gate complementarity and friction map
5. Signature/not-self interaction pattern under pressure

## Required Analysis

### 1) Type + Authority Compatibility
- Evaluate decision timing compatibility and friction.
- Show how each person experiences the other's decision style.

### 2) Conditioning Loops
- Defined/open center interactions that create chronic triggers.
- Identify loops that escalate conflict vs loops that stabilize repair.

### 3) Energetic Complement vs Interference
- Channel/gate pairings that support coherence.
- Channel/gate mismatches that create repeating misunderstandings.

### 4) Stress Dynamics
- How not-self themes collide in this pair.
- What each person must do to return to signature in relationship context.

### 5) Practical Compatibility Verdict
- State where the pair can function sustainably.
- State where mismatch is structural (not temporary mood).
- Provide concrete operational rules the pair would need.

## Analytical Rules
- Keep both charts at equal analytical depth.
- Tie claims to explicit Type/Authority/Profile/center/channel mechanics.
- Distinguish high chemistry from long-term functional compatibility.

## What This Prompt Does NOT Cover
- Global writing style and delivery rules (see `writing-style-guide.md`).
- One-person Human Design reading mode (see `human-design-individual.md`).
- Other systems (Hellenistic, Vedic, Kabbalah, Gene Keys).
- Bundle/final-verdict synthesis layer.
