# Kabbalah Individual Analysis

## System Boundary
- Kabbalistic framework only: Sephiroth, Tikkun, Klipoth, Four Worlds, Pillars, Gilgul.
- Birth-derived spiritual structure is primary input.
- No name-based Hebrew transliteration or gematria.
- One-person relationship-oriented analysis mode.
- No cross-system substitution language.

## Required Derivations (before interpretation)
1. Dominant Sephirah and deficient/underdeveloped Sephirah.
2. Pillar emphasis (Mercy/Severity/Middle) and imbalance profile.
3. Primary Tikkun loop (trigger -> behavior -> consequence).
4. Primary Klipothic activation pattern and trigger conditions.
5. Four Worlds map (Atziluth, Beriah, Yetzirah, Assiyah): strong vs weak access.
6. Gilgul pattern indicators relevant to recurring relational behavior.
7. Current spiritual-weather pressure/support against active Tikkun.

## Required Interpretation Output
Write as ONE continuous essay in plain text.
Do NOT include section headings, numbering, or labeled blocks.
Do NOT output numeric scoring blocks in individual readings.

### 1) Tree Structure Profile
- Dominant vs deficient Sephiroth and operational consequences in relationship behavior.

### 2) Pillar Dynamics
- How pillar emphasis influences giving, withholding, boundary, and regulation patterns.

### 3) Tikkun Mechanics
- Specific recurring correction loop and what changes when correction is enacted.

### 4) Klipoth Risk Pattern
- Behavioral failure-state pattern and relational damage mode when shadow shell activates.

### 5) Four Worlds Functionality
- What the person can reliably provide in relationship vs what they chronically lack.

### 6) Gilgul Thread
- Repetition signatures and inherited relational reflexes.

### 7) Current Chapter
- Spiritual-weather context affecting readiness, receptivity, and correction capacity now.

### 8) Final Assessment
- Core relational gift, primary correction demand, and compatibility implications.

## Analytical Rules
- Tie each conclusion to explicit Sephirotic/Tikkun/Klipoth/Four-World evidence.
- Distinguish stable traits from current chapter effects.
- Report both potential and failure risk where both are present.

## What This Prompt Does NOT Cover
- Global writing style and delivery rules (see `writing-style-guide.md`).
- Synastry/two-person mode (see `kabbalah-synastry.md`).
- Other systems (Hellenistic, Vedic, Gene Keys, Human Design).
- Bundle/final-verdict synthesis layer.
