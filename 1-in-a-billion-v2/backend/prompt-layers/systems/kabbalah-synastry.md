# Kabbalah Synastry Analysis

## System Boundary
- Kabbalistic two-person compatibility analysis: Sephiroth, Tikkun interaction, Klipoth interaction, Four Worlds overlap, Pillar polarity, Gilgul/Soul Contract.
- Birth-derived structure is primary input for both people.
- No name-based Hebrew transliteration or gematria.
- Both people must receive equal analytical depth.
- No cross-system substitution language.

## Required Derivations (before interpretation)

### For Each Person
1. Dominant and deficient Sephiroth.
2. Pillar emphasis and imbalance.
3. Primary Tikkun loop.
4. Primary Klipothic activation pattern.
5. Four Worlds strength/absence map.

### Cross-Interaction
6. Tikkun interaction type: support, obstruction, or collision.
7. Sefirotic complementarity vs competition map.
8. Mutual Klipothic escalation loop.
9. Pillar polarity dynamic (Mercy/Severity/Middle interactions).
10. Four Worlds overlap and shared-void map.
11. Gilgul/Soul Contract signal: completion vs repetition tendency.

## Required Interpretation Output

### 1) Person A Tree Profile
### 2) Person B Tree Profile
- Same structure and depth for both.

### 3) Combined Tree Architecture
- Where the pair stabilizes, where they destabilize, and where structural voids exist.

### 4) Tikkun Interaction Dynamics
- How each person's correction loop supports or blocks the other.

### 5) Mutual Shadow Loop
- Escalation sequence when both Klipothic patterns are active.

### 6) Four Worlds Compatibility
- Shared strengths and missing-world risk implications.

### 7) Karmic Contract Layer
- Completion vs repetition framing and practical relationship implications.

### 8) Compatibility Scores
Provide numeric score + rationale for:
1. Soul Contract Significance
2. Tikkun Compatibility
3. Daily Harmony
4. Depth and Intimacy
5. Shadow Danger
6. Spiritual Growth
7. Overall Compatibility

### 9) Final Assessment
- Required conditions for viability, main failure pattern, and best-case growth configuration.

## Analytical Rules
- Keep conclusions traceable to explicit Kabbalistic factors.
- Maintain equal depth for both people.
- Distinguish transformational intensity from structural sustainability.
- Explicitly name shared-void risks when present.

## What This Prompt Does NOT Cover
- Global writing style and delivery rules (see `writing-style-guide.md`).
- One-person mode (see `kabbalah-individual.md`).
- Other systems (Hellenistic, Vedic, Gene Keys, Human Design).
- Bundle/final-verdict synthesis layer.
