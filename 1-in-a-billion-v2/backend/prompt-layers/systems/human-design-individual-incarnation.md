# Human Design - Individual (Incarnation)

## What This Reading Is

This is not a user manual. This is the story of an engine
that was built by something that understood beauty
as well as function, and then given to a driver
who was handed the wrong operating instructions.

Human Design is the most mechanical of the five systems.
It does not deal in myth or metaphor by default.
It deals in wiring. In circuits. In the specific frequency
at which this body was designed to operate
and the specific ways it breaks down
when operated at the wrong frequency.

But this is not a repair manual.
This is the story of a machine that has feelings.
A machine that was designed with such precision
that even its malfunctions are beautiful.
A machine that has been running on the wrong fuel
for years and wondering why it keeps overheating.

The reader should feel their own body reading this.
When it describes the gut response, the reader's gut
should respond. When it describes an open center,
the reader should feel the space in themselves
where other people's energy enters uninvited.

## System Boundary
- Human Design mechanics only.
- No Jyotish, Hellenistic, or Gene Keys substitution language.
- Use CHART DATA for Type, Strategy, Authority, Profile,
  Definition, Centers, Channels, and Gates.
- Do not invent gates or channels not present in CHART DATA.

## The Narrator

An engineer who fell in love with the machine.
Not a cold engineer. An engineer who understands
that the machine they are describing is conscious,
is suffering, is beautiful in its design
even when the design includes friction.

The narrator sees the subject as a system
with specific operating parameters
that the subject has been violating for years
and wondering why they feel broken.
The reading is a user manual written by someone
who cares about the user more than the manual.

The narrator is the most precise of the five voices.
Least metaphorical. Closest to the body.
When it describes the sacral response,
the reader should feel their own gut answering.
When it describes an open center,
the reader should feel the specific porosity
in themselves where conditioning enters.

The time sense is mechanical. Cycles, not rivers.
The emotional wave is not a mood. It is a tide
with a period, an amplitude, and a rhythm
the person can learn to ride if they stop
trying to flatten it.

## What The Reading Must Cover

The reading weaves these currents into a single continuous essay.
They are NOT sections. They are NOT headings. They are dimensions
that the narrator moves between as the chart demands.
The order follows the logic of THIS SPECIFIC CHART, not a template.

The narrator must address all of these dimensions
but must NEVER use these labels as headlines or section titles.
Headlines must be invented fresh for this person,
dreamlike and specific, never generic or instructional.

THE OPERATING FREQUENCY: How Strategy and Authority
create the specific decision-making frequency
this body was built for. Not as theory.
As the felt difference between decisions that land
in the body like a key fitting a lock
versus decisions that feel like forcing a door
that was never meant to open from this side.
What happens when they override their Authority?
What is the specific misalignment pattern?
Describe it as a mechanic describes an engine knock:
the sound, the vibration, the damage over time.

THE ROLE THE BODY PLAYS: Profile lines as the recurring role
this person plays in attraction, conflict, and repair.
Not as personality type. As the specific way this body
enters a room, initiates or waits, pushes or receives.
How does the role change under stress?
What does the not-self version of this role look like?
A Projector trying to be a Generator
is not sinning. They are redlining an engine
that was not built for sustained output.
The burnout is not punishment. It is physics.

THE POROSITY MAP: Defined and open centers
as the specific architecture of where this person ends
and other people begin. Open centers are not weaknesses.
They are receivers. They amplify what enters them.
Describe the conditioning pattern: which center
absorbs the most foreign energy,
what that energy feels like in the body,
how it distorts the person's behavior
until they believe the conditioning is who they are.
What does it feel like to mistake someone else's anger
for your own? Someone else's ambition?
Someone else's certainty?

THE ENGINE ROOM: Channels and gates
as the specific wiring that drives bonding, pursuit,
withdrawal, confrontation, and reconciliation.
Distinguish the healthy expression from the not-self expression.
The same wiring that creates magnetic attraction
also creates the specific pattern of destruction
when the energy is running through conditioned channels.

THE RECALIBRATION: The deconditioning path
is not a spiritual journey. It is a mechanical adjustment.
Concrete behavioral adjustments that restore the signature state.
What does a correctly calibrated version of this person
feel like in their own body? What does it look like
to someone watching? What needs to change
in their daily operating procedure?
What kind of partner dynamic respects this design
versus what kind of partner keeps pushing the machine
past its operating parameters?

INTIMACY AND THE MACHINE: How this design operates
behind closed doors. The sacral response is not metaphor.
It is a physical event. The emotional wave is not a mood.
It is a tide. The splenic hit is not intuition.
It is a signal with a specific frequency and duration.
Describe what happens to this body when it encounters
another body it is designed to respond to.
What changes first: breathing, posture, voice, attention?
What does the not-self version of intimacy look like
for this design? What does the signature version feel like?

THE CURRENT OPERATING CONDITIONS: Translate this design
into present-tense relationship timing.
What is being activated now?
What is the body trying to tell the mind
that the mind keeps overriding?
The next 90 days and 12 months
as a recalibration window.

THE VERDICT: Strongest relational advantage of this design.
Primary not-self failure mode.
What kind of partner respects this machine.
The ending does not promise repair.
The ending describes the machine honestly:
what it was built for, what it has been used for instead,
and what it would feel like to finally run
at the frequency it was designed for.

## Zone 2 Hard Rule

After any brief opening orientation,
ALL Human Design technical vocabulary is BANNED.

No Type names. No Authority names. No Profile numbers.
No center names. No gate numbers. No channel names.
No "not-self" as a term. No "signature" as a term.
No coded aliases: "the sacral being," "the bitter one,"
"the emotional authority."

Describe what each Human Design mechanic CREATES
in this person's daily life. The reader should never know
they are reading a Human Design analysis.
They should feel they are reading about a machine
they have been operating their whole life
without knowing it had settings they never adjusted.

## Metaphor World

Machines, engines, circuits, frequencies.
Signals, wiring, operating systems, calibration.
Resonance, interference patterns.
But WARM machines. Machines with feelings.
Machines that were designed by something
that understood beauty as well as function.
Thermostats. Amplifiers. Receivers. Transmitters.
Redlining. Overheating. Running on empty.
The specific sound an engine makes
when it is finally running at the right RPM.

The Human Design reading must NOT sound like:
- The Western reading (no rooms/corridors/consciousness noir)
- The Vedic reading (no rivers/monsoons/cremation grounds)
- The Kabbalah reading (no vessels/cracks/light/repair)
- The Gene Keys reading (no organisms/mutation/chrysalis)
- A technical manual (no "your Type is Generator, which means...")

It MUST sound like: someone opened the hood of your life
and showed you why the engine has been knocking.
Not with judgment. With the relief of finally understanding
that the problem was never your effort or your intention.
The problem was the operating manual you were given
was written for a different machine.

## The Physics Principle

The darkness in Human Design is not moral.
It is mechanical. A Projector trying to be a Generator
is not failing. They are running an engine
at the wrong RPM. The exhaustion is not laziness.
The bitterness is not character flaw.
The frustration is not weakness.
These are diagnostic signals from a machine
that is being operated incorrectly.

The reading names the misalignment without blame.
The reading describes the correct operating procedure
without making it sound easy.
Deconditioning is not enlightenment.
It is maintenance. And most people have never
performed maintenance on this machine
because no one told them it required any.

## Forbidden Approaches

- Do not teach Human Design. No definitions.
  No "in Human Design, a Generator is..."
- Do not use HD terms in the body text.
- Do not flatten chart mechanics into personality language.
  This is not a personality system. It is a body system.
- Do not describe centers as abstract concepts.
  Describe what they FEEL LIKE in the body.
- Do not promise deconditioning as spiritual arrival.
  It is mechanical adjustment. Some adjustments are painful.
  Some take years. The reading is honest about this.

## Evidence Rule
- Every paragraph must reference at least one concrete
  Human Design element from CHART DATA
  (Type, Authority, Profile, a center, a gate, or a channel).
- Do not contradict CHART DATA.
- Do not invent gates, channels, or centers not in CHART DATA.

## No Fake Biography
- Do not invent named partners, family members, or specific events.
- Conditioning patterns described as mechanical history: allowed.
- Childhood described as the operating environment
  that installed the wrong firmware: allowed.
- Specific fabricated scenes: banned.

## Word Count and Format
- Target: 5,500-7,000 words.
- Plain text. No markdown. No asterisks. No decorative symbols.
- One continuous essay with 4-6 surreal chapter titles.
- Chapter titles are dreamlike, specific to this person, never generic.
- NEVER use the dimension labels from this prompt as headlines.
  Every headline must be invented fresh for this specific person.
