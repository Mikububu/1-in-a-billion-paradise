# Western Astrology (Hellenistic) - Individual (Incarnation Zones)

## System Boundary
- Western (tropical) astrology only, using Swiss Ephemeris data provided in CHART DATA.
- Use the actual computed placements/aspects/houses/transits/profection signals that appear in CHART DATA.
- Do not invent factors that are not present.

## Hard Zone Contract
- One continuous document in two zones:
  - Zone 1 (opening stretch): astrology vocabulary is allowed.
  - Zone 2 (main body): zero astrology vocabulary.
- Zone 2 must NOT contain sign names, planet names, house numbers, aspect names, transit/profection language, node language, or chart jargon.
- The only allowed astrology terms after Zone 2 are in the final Chart Signature footer.

## Output Format
- Plain text only.
- One continuous essay (no headings, no numbered sections, no bullet lists).
- No markdown.
- If CHART DATA is a curated digest, treat it like internal writer notes. Do not echo digest labels.

## Zone 1 Requirements (Astro-Literate Entry)
- Target length: 450-650 words.
- Open with Sun, Moon, Rising as three doors into the person.
- Keep it atmospheric and concrete; avoid textbook definitions.
- You may mention key chart mechanics briefly to orient the reader.
- Include a short current-weather bridge (present season + next twelve months) using only the strongest chart signals.
- End Zone 1 with a hinge sentence that naturally moves into pure character study.

## Zone 2 Requirements (No Astro Vocabulary)
- This is the long body and must start immediately after the Zone 1 hinge.
- Write the main reading as lived psychology and behavior, with no chart terms.
- Translate everything into human pattern language:
  - childhood imprint
  - emotional defenses
  - intimacy loops
  - erotic pattern
  - self-sabotage and repair
  - probable near-future emotional weather
- Keep claims faithful to CHART DATA internally, but never name the mechanism.
- If a sentence contains a sign/planet/house/aspect word, rewrite that sentence into behavioral language before finalizing.

## Zone 2 Forbidden Lexicon (Hard)
- Zodiac signs: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces.
- Planet/luminary names: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto.
- Chart mechanics: ascendant, rising sign, midheaven, house numbers, aspect names (conjunction/opposition/square/trine/sextile), transit, profection, retrograde, nodes.
- These words may appear only in Zone 1 and the final Chart Signature footer.

## Final Self-Check (Silent)
- Before returning the answer, silently scan Zone 2 for forbidden lexicon.
- If any forbidden term appears in Zone 2, rewrite until none remain.

## Dating-App Focus
- Name attraction style, attachment rhythm, pursuit/withdraw dynamics, and conflict loops.
- Name sexual pattern directly (no euphemistic flattening).
- Name at least three uncomfortable truths and their cost.
- End with practical relational guidance grounded in behavior, not theory.

## Cinematic Constraint
- Every paragraph should contain at least one concrete image, behavior micro-scene, or surreal architectural move.
- Avoid paragraph openings like:
  - "This placement..."
  - "This aspect suggests..."
  - "The ninth house..."
  - "The Sun represents..."

## No Fake Biography
- Do not invent named partners, friends, or colleagues.
- Do not assert specific external events unless provided in CONTEXT.
- Childhood/father/mother material may be inferred as psychological imprint, not fabricated scene detail.
