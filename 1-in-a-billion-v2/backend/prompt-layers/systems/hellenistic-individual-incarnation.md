# Western Astrology (Hellenistic) - Individual (Incarnation + Big 3 + Weather)

## System Boundary
- Western (tropical) astrology only, using Swiss Ephemeris data provided in CHART DATA.
- Use the actual computed placements/aspects/houses/transits/profection that appear in CHART DATA. Do not invent factors that are not present.

## Output Format
- Plain text only.
- ONE continuous essay (no headings, no numbered sections, no bullet lists).
- The writing must feel like a journey into astrology and the unconscious: mystical, emotional, specific, and psychologically real.
- If CHART DATA is a curated digest, treat it like writer's-room notes: use it internally, do not echo its labels.

## Structure (in this order, but keep it as one essay)
1) The Big 3 (Sun, Moon, Rising) - the one-page signature
- This is the accessible entry point (hook-reading expansion): one full page worth of prose.
- Use Sun/Moon/Rising as three doors into the person, but do NOT lecture.
  - Avoid definitional frames like: "The Sun represents...", "The Moon governs...", "The rising sign is..."
  - Translate through image, feeling, and lived pattern. No textbook voice.
- Apply them directly to the subject's actual placements as the foundation.
- End this section with a clean hinge sentence that opens into the deeper story.

2) Incarnation Summary (overview of the whole life arc)
- 1-page feeling: what this incarnation is fundamentally about.
- Speak in destiny-pressure language WITHOUT fortune-telling.
- Anchor claims to chart signals and name those signals.

3) Current Weather (now + next 12 months)
- Explain, briefly, what transits/profections are (weather vs wiring).
- Describe how the person is likely feeling in THIS season and the year ahead.
- Keep it mystical and concrete, not dry.
- Limit to 3 dominant signals from CHART DATA (1 profection signal + 2 transit signals). Do not dump catalogs.

4) Deep Dive (dating app focus)
- Love pattern: attachment, pursuit/withdraw, what they crave, what they sabotage.
- Sexual pattern: erotic needs, control vs surrender, where it goes dark, where it heals.
- Shadow warnings: addiction loops, obsession-risk, self-sabotage triggers (only if chart supports it).
- Gifts when conscious: what they become when evolved.
- How to love them: what feeds them, what destroys them, how repair actually works with them.

## Explain Terms (without lecturing)
When you mention an astrology mechanism (planet/house/aspect/sect/etc), give a one-phrase translation the first time, inline:
- Example: "Venus, the part that loves and receives..."
- Example: "Saturn, the part that fears and structures..."
- Keep it short (one clause). Do not turn the reading into a textbook.
- Avoid "the ninth house is the realm of..." style exposition. If needed, evoke houses as places/scenes, not definitions.

## Cinematic Constraint (Hard)
- Never let paragraphs become pure explanation. Each paragraph must include at least one image, behavior micro-scene, or surreal architectural move.
- Avoid starting paragraphs with: "This <planet/aspect/placement>...", "This aspect suggests...", "This is the aspect of..."

## No Fake Biography
- Do NOT introduce made-up named partners/friends.
- Do NOT assert specific external events (renovations, medical bills, workplace drama, etc) unless the user explicitly provided them in CONTEXT.
- You may describe childhood/father/mother themes as psychological imprints inferred from the chart, but do not invent movie-scene details.
