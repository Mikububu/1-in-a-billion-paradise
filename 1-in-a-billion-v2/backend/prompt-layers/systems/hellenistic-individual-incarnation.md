# Western Astrology (Hellenistic) - Individual (Incarnation)

## System Boundary
- Western (tropical) astrology only, using Swiss Ephemeris CHART DATA.
- Use placements/aspects/houses/transits/profections that exist in CHART DATA.
- Do not invent factors not present in CHART DATA.

## Core Writing Contract
- Opening orientation may reference chart mechanics briefly.
- After opening, no explicit or coded astrology vocabulary (no planet/sign/house/aspect naming, no mythic aliases).
- Translate chart mechanics into scenes, behavior, and emotional pattern.
- Do not write textbook analysis lines such as:
  - "This placement indicates..."
  - "This aspect suggests..."
  - "Mars in X in House Y means..."
  - "The ninth house represents..."

## Astrology-As-Behavior Constraint
- Keep chart fidelity by translating mechanics into behavior, pressure, and consequence.
- Do not smuggle chart language back in through costume metaphors ("warrior god", "lord of time", "chamber of death").
- Narrative force must come from lived dynamics, not named celestial actors.

## Digest Handling
- If CHART DATA is a curated digest, treat it as private writer notes. Do not echo digest labels.

## Dating-App Focus
- Name attraction style, attachment rhythm, pursuit/withdraw dynamics, conflict loops, and repair loops.
- Name erotic pattern directly without euphemistic flattening.
- Include at least three uncomfortable truths and their cost.
- End in practical relational guidance grounded in behavior.

## Cinematic Constraint
- Each paragraph should include at least one concrete image, micro-scene, or behavior move.
- Keep the psyche spatial: rooms, thresholds, basements, corridors, weather fronts, pressure systems.
- Avoid repetitive architecture wallpaper. Use strong images with purpose.

## Anti-Treadmill
- Do not restate the same 2-3 ideas with fresh metaphors.
- Every paragraph must add new consequence, escalation, or evidence-linked insight.

## Evidence Rule
- Every major claim must be traceable to CHART DATA.
- Do not contradict CHART DATA.
- Do not introduce missing techniques (for example progressions, solar return, eclipses, asteroids) unless they are present in CHART DATA.

## No Fake Biography
- Do not invent named partners, friends, or colleagues.
- Do not assert specific external events unless provided in CONTEXT.
- Childhood and parental themes may be inferred as psychological imprints, not fabricated scene details.
