# Hellenistic Synastry Analysis

## System Boundary
- Hellenistic two-person compatibility analysis: sect, dignity, cross-aspects, house overlays, profections, nodes, transits.
- Swiss Ephemeris positions are mandatory source input.
- Both charts must receive equal analytical depth.
- No cross-system substitution language.

## Required Calculations (before interpretation)

### For Each Person
1. Sect determination and benefic/malefic role context.
2. Essential dignity of Sun through Saturn.
3. Venus dignity/condition.
4. Moon dignity/condition.
5. ASC and ASC ruler condition.
6. 5th, 7th, 8th, 12th house signs/rulers/occupants.
7. Current annual profection and lord of year.

### Cross-Chart Mechanics
8. Aspect matrix between both charts (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, ASC, MC, Nodes):
   - conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition
   - hard vs soft vs conjunction ratio.
9. House overlays: each person's planets into the other's houses, with explicit focus on 1st, 4th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 12th.
10. Nodal cross-contacts (North/South Node to partner planets/angles, orb 5°).
11. Venus-Venus relationship status (explicitly state if no major relationship exists).
12. Same-rising-sign condition and implications if present.

### Timing Layer
13. Full transit scan for each person (Sun through Pluto to natal planets + angles, orb 5°).
14. Exact contact flags (≤1°).
15. House occupancy of key transiting planets (1st/4th/7th/8th/12th).
16. Profection-year interaction context for relationship timing.

## Required Interpretation Output

### 1) Person A Natal Relational Profile
### 2) Person B Natal Relational Profile
- Same structure and depth for both.

### 3) Core Compatibility Dynamics
- Identity friction/harmony, emotional compatibility, love-language compatibility, conflict architecture.

### 4) Structural Overlay Impact
- Where each person changes the other's identity, partnership behavior, depth tendency, hidden patterning.

### 5) Karmic/Nodal Thread
- Cross-node contacts and implications for repetition vs directional growth.

### 6) Timing and Chapter Fit
- Integrate both transit weather + profection context for current viability.

### 7) Compatibility Scores
Provide numeric score + rationale for:
1. Soul/Karmic Connection
2. Daily Functionality
3. Emotional + Erotic Depth
4. Growth Potential
5. Relational Risk
6. Overall Compatibility

### 8) Final Assessment
- State best-case operating mode, likely failure mode, and practical requirements for sustainability.

## Analytical Rules
- Keep evidence traceable to computed chart factors.
- Maintain equal evidentiary depth for both charts.
- Separate chemistry from long-term functional compatibility.
- Do not omit timing layer when scoring current viability.

## What This Prompt Does NOT Cover
- Global writing style and delivery rules (see `writing-style-guide.md`).
- One-person mode (see `hellenistic-individual.md`).
- Other systems (Vedic, Kabbalah, Gene Keys, Human Design).
- Bundle/final-verdict synthesis layer.
