# Image Transformation Prompt Layers

This is the editable source-of-truth for image transformation prompts.

- `single_portrait`: one uploaded person photo -> stylized portrait.
- `synastry_portrait`: two existing stylized portraits -> couple/synastry composition.

Keep these blocks concise and direct so the image model follows them reliably.

## single_portrait

<!-- PROMPT:single_portrait:start -->
Torso shot in a black Yamamoto dress against a red background.
<!-- PROMPT:single_portrait:end -->

## synastry_portrait

<!-- PROMPT:synastry_portrait:start -->
Compose these two stylized portraits into one couple portrait head on head. White background. Show emotional closeness and mutual presence without adding text or symbols.
<!-- PROMPT:synastry_portrait:end -->
