# Image Transformation Prompt Layers

This is the editable source-of-truth for image transformation prompts.

- `single_portrait`: one uploaded person photo -> stylized portrait.
- `synastry_portrait`: two existing stylized portraits -> couple/synastry composition.

Keep these blocks concise and direct so the image model follows them reliably.

## single_portrait

<!-- PROMPT:single_portrait:start -->
High-contrast linoleum handcrafted style. Bold black carved strokes on textured off-white paper. Smooth hand-cut edges and strong negative space. Minimal palette: black, off-white, and a restrained red accent only when natural. Keep the real face recognizable while stylizing. 2D graphic illustration look, not photorealism. Subject should fill the full frame edge-to-edge with no empty border.
<!-- PROMPT:single_portrait:end -->

## synastry_portrait

<!-- PROMPT:synastry_portrait:start -->
Compose these two stylized portraits into one intimate couple portrait. Preserve the exact same visual style and keep both faces recognizable from the inputs. Show emotional closeness and mutual presence without adding text or symbols. Tight composition: both subjects fill the frame edge-to-edge with minimal empty space.
<!-- PROMPT:synastry_portrait:end -->
