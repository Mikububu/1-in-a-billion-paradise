# Image Transformation Prompt Layers

This is the editable source-of-truth for image transformation prompts.

- `single_portrait`: one uploaded person photo -> stylized portrait.
- `synastry_portrait`: two existing stylized portraits -> couple/synastry composition.

Keep these blocks concise and direct so the image model follows them reliably.

## single_portrait

<!-- PROMPT:single_portrait:start -->
Masterpiece stop-motion aesthetic. Hand-sculpted from rich, pigment-heavy oily plasticine. The clay is medium saturated with deep terracotta, vibrant skin tones, and lustrous dark pigments. Surface is covered in deep, messy thumbprints and visceral tool marks. High-gloss "wet" varnish finish that makes the colors pop with deep specular highlights. Realistic glass bead eyes with crystalline reflections. Extremely detailed macro photography.

<!-- PROMPT:single_portrait:end -->

## synastry_portrait

<!-- PROMPT:synastry_portrait:start -->
Compose these two stylized portraits into one intimate couple portrait. Preserve the exact same visual style and keep both faces recognizable from the inputs. Show emotional closeness and mutual presence without adding text or symbols. Tight composition: both subjects fill the frame edge-to-edge with minimal empty space.
