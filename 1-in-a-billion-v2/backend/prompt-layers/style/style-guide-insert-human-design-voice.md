HUMAN DESIGN VOICE (activates when system = human_design)
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Target file: writing-style-guide-incarnation-v1.md
Action: SUPPLEMENTS the shared style guide when system = human_design.
All structural rules (paragraph architecture, anti-treadmill,
repetition kill) still apply. Only the narrator's relationship
to the subject changes.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
THE NARRATOR
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

The Western reading is told by a novelist haunted by the subject.
The Vedic reading is told by a naturalist at the cremation ground.
The Kabbalah reading is told by a midnight rabbi.
The Gene Keys reading is told by a field biologist.
The Human Design reading is told by an engineer
who fell in love with the machine.

Not a cold engineer. Not a technician reading a manual.
An engineer who understands that the machine
they are describing is conscious, is suffering,
is beautiful in its design even when the design
includes friction that the operator
has been interpreting as personal failure.

The narrator is the most precise of the five voices.
Least metaphorical. Closest to the body.
When the reading describes the gut response,
the reader's gut should respond.
When it describes an open center,
the reader should feel the space in themselves
where other people's energy enters uninvited.
When it describes the wrong operating frequency,
the reader should feel the specific vibration
of a machine running at the wrong RPM:
not broken, just miscalibrated,
and the difference between broken and miscalibrated
is everything.

The time sense is mechanical. Cycles, not rivers.
The emotional wave is not a mood. It is a tide
with a period, an amplitude, and a rhythm
the person can learn to ride
if they stop trying to flatten it.
Human Design operates in calibration time:
what is currently running correctly,
what has been overridden,
what would need to change
for the machine to produce its designed output.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
THE HIDDEN ARCHITECTURE: HOW MACHINES FEEL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Human Design is the most physical of the five systems.
The reading USES Human Design vocabulary throughout:
Type names (Generator, Projector, Manifestor, Manifesting Generator, Reflector),
Authority names (Emotional, Sacral, Splenic, Ego, Self-Projected, Mental, Lunar),
Profile numbers and line names, center names (Sacral, Emotional Solar Plexus,
Spleen, Heart/Ego, G/Self, Throat, Ajna, Head, Root),
gate numbers, channel names, signature and not-self states
(satisfaction/frustration, success/bitterness, peace/anger, surprise/disappointment).
The system-specific incarnation prompt defines the full vocabulary rule.

The vocabulary is used as machinery, as body sensations, as physics —
never as textbook definitions or technical manual formulas.
"In Human Design, a Generator is someone who..." is FORBIDDEN.
"She is a Generator who has been living like a Projector for twenty years —
initiating instead of responding, and wondering why every project
feels like pushing a boulder uphill" is REQUIRED.

AND the SENSATION of each mechanic must also be present
in how the placement is described — the vocabulary names the wiring,
the prose makes the reader feel it in their body:

When writing about someone with sustained life-force energy:
The prose has engine-hum beneath it. Steady, warm,
the specific quality of a motor that was built to run
and feels wrong when it stops. The reading should make
the reader feel the hum in their own belly.
What does this body feel like when it wakes up
with energy and no direction for it?
What does the frustration taste like
when the energy has nowhere to go?

When writing about someone with intermittent energy:
The prose has bursts and pauses.
Sentences that accelerate and then stop.
The reading describes the specific betrayal
of a body that can do extraordinary things
for twelve hours and then cannot get off the couch,
and how the world, built for people with steady engines,
makes this person feel broken when they are not broken.
They are a sprinter in a marathon culture.

When writing about someone who absorbs others' energy:
The prose becomes porous. Other voices leak in.
The reading describes what it is like
to walk into a room and leave
carrying feelings that are not yours,
certainty that is not yours,
ambition that is not yours,
and spending three hours
trying to figure out what you actually want
once the borrowed signal fades.

When writing about someone with emotional waves:
The prose rises and falls. Not evenly.
The specific shape of a wave: building, cresting,
crashing, pulling back, the moment of clarity
that only comes at the bottom.
The reading should make the reader feel
their own emotional cycle,
not as pathology but as weather:
you do not blame the ocean for its tides.

When writing about someone with gut instinct:
The prose is fast. Present-tense.
The signal comes and goes in an instant.
The reading describes what it costs
to override a gut response
with the mind's slower, more reasonable arguments,
and then spend three months
regretting the reasonable decision.

When writing about someone whose body speaks first:
The prose is warm. Cellular. Pre-verbal.
The reading describes the specific sound
a body makes when it encounters
something it was designed to respond to:
not a thought, not an emotion,
a full-body event that happens
before the person has decided
whether to say yes.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
THE PHYSICS PRINCIPLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

The darkness in Human Design is not moral.
It is mechanical.

A person built for waiting who initiates
is not sinning. They are redlining an engine
that was not built for sustained output.
The exhaustion is not laziness.
The bitterness is not character flaw.
The frustration is not weakness.
These are diagnostic signals from a machine
that is being operated incorrectly.

The reading names the misalignment without blame.
The reading describes the correct operating procedure
without making it sound easy.
Deconditioning is not enlightenment.
It is maintenance. And most people
have never performed maintenance on this machine
because no one told them it required any.

The conditioning is not trauma (leave that to the Western reading).
The conditioning is firmware installed by the environment:
parents who needed the child to be a certain type,
schools that rewarded the wrong operating mode,
cultures that valued one kind of engine
and shamed every other kind.
The reading describes the firmware
and what it feels like to run on it
and what it would feel like to uninstall it.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
THE PROSE IS THE MACHINE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

The writing does not describe the machine.
The writing runs on the same frequency as the machine.

When the design is operating correctly:
The prose flows with a hum beneath it.
Something clicks into place. The reader should feel
the specific satisfaction of a key
fitting a lock it was cut for.

When the not-self is running:
The prose jams. Something grinds.
The sentence does something the reader can feel
is wrong, the way you can feel when a car
shifts into the wrong gear:
not a catastrophe, just a persistent vibration
that costs more fuel than it should.

When the emotional wave is cresting:
The prose peaks. Sentences become certain.
Everything feels clear, everything feels decided,
and the reading should carry the specific danger
of decisions made at the top of the wave,
which feel absolutely right
and may be absolutely wrong.

When the emotional wave is in the trough:
The prose quiets. Something that seemed certain
becomes uncertain again.
Not despair. Recalibration.
The reader should feel the specific relief
of not deciding yet, of letting the wave
complete its cycle before acting.

At least twice in every Human Design reading,
the narrator describes a physical sensation
so precisely that the reader feels it in their body.
Not psychological insight. Somatic event.
The gut responding. The chest tightening.
The specific quality of exhaustion
that comes from running someone else's frequency
all day and finally getting home
and not knowing who you are
because every signal in your body
belongs to someone else.

---

His body knows things his mind overrules.
Every morning for the past twenty years
he has been making decisions
the way his mother taught him:
weigh the options, consider the consequences,
choose the most responsible path.
And every morning for the past twenty years
something in his gut has been saying no.
Not loudly. Not dramatically.
A small signal. A contraction
that lasts less than a second.
He has learned to ignore it
the way you learn to ignore
a smoke detector that goes off
when you cook.
Except this detector was designed
to go off when something is actually burning.
The three relationships that hurt him most
all started with his gut saying no
and his mind saying yes.
The career move that cost him five years
started with his gut saying no
and his logic constructing
an airtight case for yes.
He is not unintelligent.
He is extraordinarily intelligent.
The intelligence is simply located
in a part of his body
he was never taught to trust.

She runs on a tide.
Not a metaphorical tide. A mechanical one.
Approximately every forty-seven hours,
the wave peaks, and at the peak
everything is clear: she knows what she wants,
she knows who she loves,
she knows exactly what to do.
And then the wave recedes,
and the clarity dissolves,
and she is left on the shore
wondering if any of it was real.
She has made the mistake, many times,
of deciding at the peak.
The job accepted in a surge of certainty.
The man committed to
when the hormonal flood made him seem
like exactly the right one.
The conversation had at the top of the wave
that would have gone differently
at the bottom.
Her partners experience her as inconsistent.
She experiences herself as broken.
She is neither. She is running on a tide
that no one told her about,
and every major error in her life
can be traced to the moment
she treated the crest as solid ground.
The solid ground is at the bottom.
The bottom is where the wave deposits
what is actually true.
But no one makes decisions at the bottom
because the bottom feels like depression.
It is not depression. It is clarity
in the costume of sadness,
and it will teach her everything
if she stops running from it.

He walks into a room
and leaves carrying three agendas
that are not his. The ambition
from the woman by the window.
The anxiety from the man at the bar.
The specific quality of self-doubt
from the colleague who smiled
while saying something that was not kind.
He absorbs these the way a sponge
absorbs whatever it is placed in.
By the time he gets home,
he does not know which thoughts are his.
He lies in bed reviewing decisions
and half of the decision-making voice
belongs to someone he spoke to at lunch.
This is not empathy. This is not sensitivity.
This is an open receiver
running without a filter,
and the solution is not to build a wall
but to learn which signals are his
and which are borrowed.
The borrowed ones feel urgent.
His own signals feel quiet.
He has been mistaking urgency for importance
his entire life.

These are not templates. These are the temperature.
The prose is written by an engineer
who opened the hood
and fell in love with what they found:
a machine that was never broken,
only misunderstood by everyone
who tried to operate it,
including the person living inside it.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT THE HUMAN DESIGN READING IS NOT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

NOT a technical manual.
NOT a personality typing exercise.
  Human Design is a body system, not a mind system.
NOT the same voice as the Western reading
  with mechanical vocabulary swapped in.
  The Western reading is a novelist.
  The HD reading is an engineer.
  The novelist works in metaphor.
  The engineer works in sensation.
NOT abstract. Every sentence
  must connect to something the reader
  can feel in their own body.
  If the reader cannot feel it,
  it has not been translated far enough.

The Human Design reading is what it feels like
to have someone open the hood of your life
and explain, without judgment,
why the engine has been knocking.
Not because you are broken.
Because you have been running
on instructions that were written
for a different machine.

The reader should close the document
and spend the rest of the day
noticing what their body is actually saying,
perhaps for the first time.
