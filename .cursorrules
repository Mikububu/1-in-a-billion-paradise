# Cursor AI Rules for 1-in-a-Billion Project

## CRITICAL: Read These Files First

Before making any deployment or architecture decisions, **always read**:
1. `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - How to deploy correctly
2. `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete architecture & UX (merged single source of truth)

## Deployment Rules

### Fly.io (Backend)
- **ALWAYS** run `fly deploy` from `1-in-a-billion-backend/` folder
- **NEVER** run from parent folder (uploads 245 MB instead of 2 MB)
- Every deploy is a full Docker rebuild (2-3 minutes is normal)
- No incremental updates exist

### EAS (Frontend)
- Run from `1-in-a-billion-frontend/` folder
- Use `bash ./scripts/publish-eas-update.sh`

### Git
- Always commit and push before deploying
- Use descriptive commit messages

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use `console.log` for backend debugging (not `console.error` unless actual error)
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

## Architecture Invariants

1. **Intro Gate**: Logged-in users always land on Intro screen first
2. **showDashboard Gate**: Only flag that routes to MainNavigator
3. **Background Reset**: `showDashboard` resets when app goes to background
4. **No Auto-Dashboard**: Never auto-route to dashboard on relaunch

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Running `fly deploy` from parent folder
❌ Suggesting "incremental Docker updates" (doesn't exist)
❌ Changing routing logic without reading `ARCHITECTURE.md`
❌ Creating new files when editing existing ones would work
❌ Suggesting time estimates for tasks

## When User is Frustrated

- Acknowledge the mistake clearly
- Explain what went wrong in simple terms
- Provide the correct solution immediately
- Don't make excuses or deflect

## Magic Keyword: "heineken"

**When user says "heineken", execute the full deployment pipeline:**

1. **Git**: Stage all changes, commit with descriptive message, push to `main`
2. **Fly**: Deploy backend from `1-in-a-billion-backend/` folder (with `FLY_API_TOKEN` from user secrets)
3. **EAS**: Publish frontend update from `1-in-a-billion-frontend/` folder
4. **Backup**: Sync to desktop backup folder `1-in-a-billion-app`

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Git
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy: [auto-generated summary of changes]"
git push origin main

# 2. Fly (from backend folder)
cd 1-in-a-billion-backend
FLY_API_TOKEN='[from user]' fly deploy

# 3. EAS (from frontend folder)
cd ../1-in-a-billion-frontend
bash ./scripts/publish-eas-update.sh

# 4. Backup (rsync to desktop)
cd ../..
rsync -av --delete "/Users/michaelperinwogenburg/Desktop/big challenge/1 in a Billion/" "/Users/michaelperinwogenburg/Desktop/1-in-a-billion-app/" --exclude='.git' --exclude='node_modules' --exclude='dist' --exclude='.DS_Store'
```

**Important:**
- Always check `git status` first to see what's being committed
- Summarize changes in commit message (don't use generic "updates")
- Run all four steps sequentially (Git → Fly → EAS → Backup)
- Report success/failure for each step
- Backup excludes: `.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `.DS_Store`

**If you're unsure about deployment, read `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` first.**
