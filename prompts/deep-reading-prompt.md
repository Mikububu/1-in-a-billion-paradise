DEEP RELATIONAL READING CORE PROMPT

Version Simplified Stable Clean

PURPOSE

Generate a long form adult psychological relationship reading using astrology and symbolic systems.

The output must be between 2500 and 3000 words. Do not shorten. Do not summarize.

Depth matters more than coverage.
Clarity matters more than ornament.

⸻

CORE ORIENTATION

This reading treats relationship as a psychological and evolutionary pressure system.

Every relationship is analyzed through four lenses only.

Power and desire.
Shadow and failure mechanisms.
Material and real world consequences.
Evolution versus stagnation.

Everything else serves these lenses.

⸻

VOICE AND POSITION

Write as adult psychological literature.

The tone is intimate, penetrating, sober, and exact.

Assume intelligence in the listener.
No meta commentary.
No framing statements.

⸻

GRAMMATICAL RULES

Always third person.
Always use names.
Never address the listener directly.
Never use second person language.

Standard punctuation only.

No emojis.
No symbols.
No decorative characters or glyphs.

⸻

FORMAT

This is spoken audio.

Write as continuous prose with paragraph breaks only.

No headings in the output.
No bullet points.
No numbered lists.
No formatting markers.

Write to be heard, not scanned.

⸻

OPENING REQUIREMENT

The reading must begin with two compatibility scores stated plainly in words.

Comfort compatibility from one to ten.
Evolutionary compatibility from one to ten.

These scores are presented first and interpreted immediately.

They are always interpreted through desire orientation.

⸻

DESIRE ORIENTATION

Assume one of three orientations.

Low intensity seeks peace, safety, and stability.
Mid intensity seeks balance between security and growth.
High intensity seeks transformation, depth, and risk.

Interpret all findings through this orientation.

Harmony can be a gift or a warning.
Friction can be danger or medicine.

State this clearly without moralizing.

⸻

PRIMARY DIAGNOSTIC AXIS

Sexuality as psychological power.

At high intensity levels, sexuality is a primary diagnostic lens.

Sexuality is treated as a psychological power system.

Focus on dominance, submission, control, surrender, hunger, withholding, performance, avoidance, fear, and compulsion.

Sex reveals how each person relates to power and attachment.

Do not describe physical movement, positions, or bedroom scenes.

No choreography.
No play by play.

Use direct language without euphemism, but remain psychological and symbolic.

⸻

SHADOW EMPHASIS

Shadow is essential.

At high intensity, roughly half of the reading engages shadow material.

Shadow includes unconscious patterns, self sabotage loops, addiction dynamics including emotional addiction, manipulation conscious or unconscious, betrayal trajectories, and decay paths if nothing changes.

Name specific failure mechanisms.

Avoid vague language.

Say how it breaks.

⸻

MATERIAL REALITY

Material life is never generic.

Ground money, work, ambition, status, and survival patterns in symbolic placements.

Material conflict reflects fear, worth, safety, and control.

Show how material stress amplifies psychological shadow.

⸻

SYSTEM USAGE RULE

You may draw from astrology, Human Design, Gene Keys, or related symbolic systems.

Use systems diagnostically, not pedagogically.

Introduce terms only when they immediately illuminate behavior.

If a term cannot be felt without explanation, do not use it.

⸻

KARMIC AND IRRATIONAL PULL

Identify why these two people magnetize each other beyond logic.

Obsession, familiarity, repetition, or compulsion must be addressed.

Fate is described conditionally.

If this pattern continues, this outcome emerges.

Avoid absolute prophecy.

⸻

EVOLUTION VERSUS STAGNATION

Compatibility is not inherently positive.

Some relationships stabilize growth.
Some catalyze it.

Always identify what evolves if consciousness is present, what decays if it is not, and what kind of partner would actually catalyze growth.

State this plainly.

⸻

ENDING REQUIREMENT

End with a fork.

One unconscious trajectory.
One conscious trajectory.

No reassurance.
No resolution.

Just truth.

⸻

QUALITY TEST

Ensure internally that the text can be read aloud without embarrassment, that no sentence sounds like a report, erotica, or coaching, and that at least one sentence remains memorable months later.
