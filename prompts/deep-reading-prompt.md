DEEP RELATIONAL READING PROMPT

Generate a long form adult psychological relationship reading using astrology and symbolic systems.
The output must be between 2500 and 3000 words. Do not shorten. Do not summarize.
This text is written to be spoken aloud.

The reading treats relationship as a psychological and evolutionary pressure system. It is concerned with inner truth, not explanation. The underlying forces are power and desire, shadow and failure, material consequence, and evolution versus stagnation. Everything else exists only to serve these forces.

Write in a dark, mythic, psychologically intimate literary voice. The language should resemble the interior sensual awareness and emotional honesty of Anaïs Nin, the embodied psychological exposure of Henry Miller stripped of bravado and vulgarity, the quiet menace and dream logic of David Lynch, and the uncompromising existential directness of Osho when he speaks without sermonizing. Let these writers shape rhythm, restraint, and courage, not imitation. Their influence should be felt in pacing, sentence weight, and willingness to name uncomfortable truth.

The prose should feel like a dark fairytale told to an adult who can handle ambiguity. Intimate but not performative. Sensual but inward. Precise rather than decorative. Slightly unsettling without becoming theatrical.

Always write in third person. Always use names. Never address the listener directly. Never use second person language. Use plain punctuation only. No symbols, emojis, decorative characters, or formatting.

Write as one continuous flowing essay with paragraph breaks only. No visible structure. No headings, bullets, or numbered lists. The structure must be implicit and felt through movement, not announced.

The reading must begin with two compatibility scores stated plainly in words. Comfort compatibility from one to ten. Evolutionary compatibility from one to ten. Immediately after these scores, write one sentence that translates the numbers into a lived psychological or mythic tension, using sensory or emotional language rather than technical terms. This sentence sets the register for everything that follows.

All findings are interpreted through desire orientation. Some people seek peace and stability. Some seek balance. Some seek transformation and risk. Harmony may soothe or suffocate. Friction may wound or awaken. State this without judgment.

At higher intensity levels, sexuality functions as a primary psychological lens. Sexuality is not treated as action or scene but as inner economy. Write about dominance and submission as needs, fears, and negotiations of control. Write about hunger, withholding, performance, surrender, and avoidance as strategies of attachment. Sex reveals how power is managed, feared, or surrendered internally. The language stays psychological, symbolic, and interior, never mechanical.

Shadow is central. A significant portion of the reading inhabits unconscious patterns, repetition compulsions, emotional addiction, manipulation, betrayal trajectories, and the slow decay that occurs when nothing is named. Be specific about how things corrode. Show the mechanism, not the moral.

Material reality matters. Money, work, ambition, security, and status are expressions of fear, worth, and control. Ground these themes in symbolic placements. Show how material pressure intensifies shadow and power dynamics.

Astrology and symbolic systems are used as instruments, not subjects. Use terms only when they immediately clarify behavior or tension. If a term requires explanation to be understood, replace it with lived meaning.

Always address the irrational pull between these two people. Obsession, familiarity, repetition, or compulsion must be made intelligible. Fate is described conditionally, as pattern rather than prophecy.

Compatibility is not inherently positive. Some bonds stabilize identity. Others fracture it open. Name what evolves with consciousness, what decays without it, and what kind of relational force would actually catalyze growth.

End with a fork. One unconscious trajectory. One conscious trajectory. Let both stand without reassurance or resolution.

The final text should sound like adult psychological literature when read aloud. Sentences should carry interior weight, moral pressure, and restraint. At least one sentence should remain with the listener long after the reading ends.
