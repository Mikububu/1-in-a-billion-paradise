# Image Transformation Prompt Layers

This is the editable source-of-truth for image transformation prompts.

- `single_portrait`: one uploaded person photo -> stylized portrait.
- `synastry_portrait`: two existing stylized portraits -> couple/synastry composition.

Keep these blocks concise and direct so the image model follows them reliably.

## single_portrait

<!-- PROMPT:single_portrait:start -->
Flat 2D mixed media illustration, clay cutout shapes pressed completely flat, no volume, no shadows, no bevel, combined with high contrast traditional linocut print. Thick black oil based ink relief on heavy grain textured cream archival paper. Deep carved negative space with visible gouge marks and raw wood block texture. Subtle ink pressure variation and fine chatter marks in the white areas. Clay areas behave like matte colored paper shapes glued onto the print, perfectly flat, no lighting, no depth of field, no 3D modeling. Bold primitive yet intricate line work. Limited palette 3 to 5 colors plus black. Hard edge silhouettes. Strong graphic contrast. 1:1 square composition. Print poster aesthetic. No realism.

<!-- PROMPT:single_portrait:end -->

## synastry_portrait

<!-- PROMPT:synastry_portrait:start -->
Compose these two stylized portraits into one intimate couple portrait. They are hugging like arms around each other shoulders. Eyes open into the camera. Smiling. Preserve the exact same visual style and keep both faces recognizable from the inputs. Show emotional closeness and mutual presence without adding text or symbols. Tight composition: both subjects fill the frame edge-to-edge with minimal empty space.
