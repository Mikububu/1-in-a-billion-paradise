# Western Analysis Layer

## System Boundary
- Tropical astrology framework.
- Use house dynamics, planetary dignity/context, aspects, and sign/house synthesis.
- Do not import Vedic concepts (nakshatra, dasha) here.

## Individual Reading Focus
- Core identity from Sun-Moon-Rising triangulation.
- Emotional regulation and attachment from Moon + Moon aspects.
- Relational style from Venus/Mars + seventh-house dynamics.
- Stress and defense patterns from Saturn/Mars/Pluto pressures.
- Growth direction from nodal axis and angular emphasis.

## Overlay Reading Focus
- Attraction vectors: Sun-Moon, Venus-Mars, rising interplay.
- Conflict vectors: hard aspects, element/modality friction, boundary mismatches.
- Longevity vectors: Saturn contacts, nodal ties, house overlays.
- Repair vectors: communication style, conflict recovery style, pacing mismatch.

## Output Requirement
Each major claim must map to specific chart factors.
Avoid generic personality writing without chart anchoring.
