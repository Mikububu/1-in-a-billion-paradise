# Kabbalah Analysis Layer (V2)

## System Boundary
- Kabbalistic framework: tikkun, sefirotic balance, klipothic shadow, four worlds.
- Birth-derived structure is primary.
- No name-based Hebrew transliteration or gematria axis.

## Name/Gematria Policy
- Disabled for core interpretation.
- Do not center, derive, or pivot the reading on name numerology.

## Individual Reading Focus
- Tikkun as repeating behavioral loop (not abstract sermon).
- Dominant/weak sefirot translated into daily relational behavior.
- Klipothic activations as trigger -> behavior -> consequence patterns.
- Four Worlds imbalance as lived absence/presence pattern.
- Mercy/Severity/Middle pillar dynamic in intimacy, conflict, and self-governance.

## Overlay Reading Focus
- Tikkun interaction: support vs obstruction loops.
- Sefirotic complementarity and competition zones.
- Shared klipothic danger loops and escalation pathways.
- Pillar polarity dynamics (giver/withholder, boundary/control patterns).
- Four Worlds overlap and shared voids in the bond.

## Output Requirement
Use Kabbalistic terms with one natural explanation on first use.
Then keep language concrete, behavioral, and specific.
