# Human Design Individual Analysis

## System Boundary
- Human Design mechanics only.
- Prioritize Type, Strategy, Authority, Profile, definition, centers, key channels/gates.

## Required Analysis
1. Type mechanics and signature/not-self baseline.
2. Strategy + Authority as decision reliability.
3. Profile and recurring relational role pattern.
4. Defined vs open centers and conditioning exposure.
5. Main channel/gate themes affecting love and conflict.
6. What deconditioning would practically change in relationships.

## Relationship Read Focus
- How this person enters connection, handles pressure, communicates needs, and restores alignment.

## Analytical Rules
- Explain Human Design terms naturally on first use.
- Keep language practical and behavioral.
- No mystical vagueness detached from mechanics.
