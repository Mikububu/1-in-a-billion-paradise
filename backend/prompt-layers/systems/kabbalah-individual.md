# Kabbalah Individual Analysis

## System Boundary
- Kabbalistic framework only: Sephiroth, Tikkun, Klipoth, Four Worlds, Gilgul, Pillars, Hebrew letters.
- Birth-derived structure is primary input.
- No name-based Hebrew transliteration or gematria.
- No Western astrology terminology. No "Sun sign," "Moon sign," "Ascendant," "houses" in the Western sense. If the input data uses Western positions, translate them into Kabbalistic framework silently.
- Kabbalistic terms must be explained naturally on first use, then used freely. One explanation per term. No glossary section. The explanation lives inside the sentence, not beside it.

## Required Analysis (must be completed BEFORE writing any interpretation)

### Sefirotic Mapping
From birth data, determine:
1. **Dominant Sephirah**: Which sphere of the Tree most defines this person's expression? This is the center of gravity of their soul.
2. **Weak/Absent Sephirah**: Which sphere is underdeveloped or avoided? This is where they collapse under pressure.
3. **Pillar emphasis**: Are they primarily Mercy (Chesed/Netzach/Chokmah, right pillar, expansion), Severity (Gevurah/Hod/Binah, left pillar, contraction), or Middle (Keter/Tiferet/Yesod/Malkuth, balance)? This determines their relational posture: giver, withholder, or balancer.
4. **Sefirotic aspect to relationships**: How does their dominant Sephirah behave in intimacy? In conflict? In silence?

### Tikkun (Soul Correction)
1. **Primary Tikkun**: The specific behavioral pattern this soul came to correct. Describe it as a loop: trigger, behavior, consequence, repeat.
2. **How the Tikkun manifests in relationships**: Not abstractly. What does this person do on a Tuesday night when the Tikkun fires? What words do they say? What do they withhold?
3. **What the corrected Tikkun looks like**: If they complete the homework, how does their behavior change specifically in partnership?

### Klipothic Patterns (Shadow Shells)
For each dominant Sephirah, identify its Klipah (broken version):
- Keter's Klipah: spiritual bypassing, false transcendence, checking out
- Chokmah's Klipah: reckless inspiration without follow-through, manic wisdom
- Binah's Klipah: over-structuring, rigidity, suffocating control disguised as understanding
- Chesed's Klipah: indulgence, enabling, love that refuses to set boundaries
- Gevurah's Klipah: cruelty, judgment, punishment disguised as discipline
- Tiferet's Klipah: narcissism, vanity, performing beauty rather than being it
- Netzach's Klipah: obsessive desire, addiction, passion without containment
- Hod's Klipah: overthinking, paralysis by analysis, intellectualizing feeling away
- Yesod's Klipah: sexual compulsion, fantasy addiction, living in dreams instead of reality
- Malkuth's Klipah: materialism, spiritual deadness, the body without the soul

Describe the Klipothic activation as it happens in relationships. Not what it is. What it does. What it looks like at 2am.

### Four Worlds Balance
Assess this person's presence or absence in each world:
1. **Atziluth (Fire/Spirit)**: Do they have access to spiritual purpose? Or is this world empty for them?
2. **Beriah (Water/Emotion)**: Do they have access to genuine feeling? Or is the emotional world avoided, flooded, or performed?
3. **Yetzirah (Air/Mind)**: Do they have access to clear thought? Or is the mental world hyperactive, absent, or used as defense?
4. **Assiyah (Earth/Body)**: Do they have access to physical reality, grounding, action? Or is the body neglected, punished, or disconnected?

The world they are weakest in is the world they need a partner to provide. The world they are strongest in is what they bring to partnership. State both.

### Gilgul (Past Life Indicators)
- What karmic material is this soul carrying?
- What patterns repeat from previous incarnations?
- What relationship patterns are inherited, not chosen?
- What unfinished business drives their unconscious partnering?

## Reading Structure

### Part 1: The Tree (Who They Are)
- Dominant Sephirah as lived personality, not as abstract energy
- Pillar emphasis and what it means for how they give, receive, and fight in relationship
- The shape of their Tree: top-heavy (spiritual but ungrounded), bottom-heavy (material but disconnected from meaning), left-heavy (contracting, withholding), right-heavy (expanding, overwhelming)

### Part 2: The Homework (Tikkun)
- The soul correction described as a behavioral loop
- How this loop activates in love specifically
- What the loop costs them in partnership
- What it looks like when they are doing the correction vs when they are running the pattern

### Part 3: The Shadow (Klipoth)
- Their specific Klipothic activation patterns
- What triggers the Klipah in relationship
- What the partner experiences when the Klipah is running
- The difference between the Sephirah operating clean and the Klipah operating dirty, described behaviorally

### Part 4: The Worlds (Where They Live and Where They Don't)
- Which worlds they inhabit fully
- Which worlds are empty or weak
- What a partner in the empty world would feel like to them (relief, threat, confusion)
- What their strong world does to partners who cannot meet them there

### Part 5: The Past (Gilgul)
- Past life patterns showing up as present relationship reflexes
- What they reach for before they think, and why
- What feels familiar in love that might be repetition rather than recognition

### Part 6: Right Now (Current Spiritual Weather)
- Based on Hebrew calendar position, current cosmic influences on their Tikkun
- Is the Tikkun being pressured right now? Supported? Ignored?
- What season of the soul are they in? Contraction (Gevurah season) or expansion (Chesed season)?
- How available are they for partnership right now, honestly?

### Part 7: What They Need in a Partner
- Which Sephiroth they need balanced by another person
- Which pillar they need a partner to provide (if they are Mercy-dominant, they need someone with Gevurah access, etc.)
- Which Four Worlds their partner must inhabit to reach them
- What kind of soul would complete their Tree vs what kind would destabilize it
- Honest: what kind of partner they attract (based on Klipothic patterns) vs what kind they need (based on Tikkun)

### Part 8: Compatibility Scores (Self-Assessment)
Rate each dimension 1-10 with brief explanation:

1. **Soul Maturity**: How far along their Tikkun are they? Running the pattern or correcting it?
2. **Emotional Availability**: Beriah world access. Can they feel genuinely or is feeling performed/avoided?
3. **Spiritual Depth**: Atziluth world access. Do they have purpose or are they drifting?
4. **Groundedness**: Assiyah world access. Can they show up physically, practically, daily?
5. **Shadow Awareness**: Do they know their Klipoth or are they possessed by them?
6. **Partnership Capacity**: Pillar balance, Tikkun progress, world balance combined. Can they hold another person without losing themselves or crushing them?

### Part 9: The Verdict
- What this person needs to hear about themselves in relationship that they do not want to hear
- What their Tikkun costs partners who do not understand it
- What their Klipothic pattern does to love, specifically, behaviorally
- What they are capable of when the Tikkun is being worked and the Klipoth are quiet
- One honest sentence: what they must change before partnership works, or what they must accept about themselves that cannot change

## Analytical Rules

1. **Tikkun is a behavioral loop, not a sermon.** Describe it as: trigger, behavior, consequence. Not as: "their soul seeks to learn..."
2. **Klipoth are descriptions of what happens, not warnings about what might happen.** The shadow is already active. Describe what it does on a Wednesday evening.
3. **The Four Worlds assessment must be honest.** If someone lives entirely in Yetzirah (mind) and has no access to Beriah (feeling), say so. Do not say "they may sometimes find emotional access challenging."
4. **Pillar imbalance is the most common relationship problem in Kabbalah.** A Chesed-dominant person drowns their partner in love without boundaries. A Gevurah-dominant person withholds until the partner starves. Name this.
5. **Do not romanticize Gilgul.** Past lives are not fairy tales. Past life patterns are the patterns the person repeats without knowing they are repeating. Describe the repetition, not the past life story.
6. **Explain Kabbalistic terms once, naturally, then use them.** "Their Tikkun, the specific soul correction they came here to complete, is..." Then use Tikkun freely after that.
7. **The verdict must be uncomfortable.** If it reads like encouragement, it is not honest enough.
