# Vedic Synastry Analysis

## System Boundary
- Pure Vedic Jyotish compatibility.
- No Western framework language.

## Required Analysis
1. For each person: Lagna, Moon Nakshatra, key graha condition, Dasha context.
2. Cross-comparison of karmic patterns via Rahu-Ketu and Saturn links.
3. 7th Bhava and relationship-house overlays in practical terms.
4. Ashtakuta-style compatibility framing when relevant.
5. Nadi-style risk framing when relevant.
6. Current transit weather on both charts, not only one.

## Verdict Orientation
- Distinguish karmic pull from sustainable compatibility.
- Name where the pair supports dharma and where they amplify shadow.

## Analytical Rules
- Equal depth for both people.
- Behavior-first explanation, not abstract doctrine.
- Continuous prose output only.
