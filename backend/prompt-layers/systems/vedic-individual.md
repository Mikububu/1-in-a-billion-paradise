# Vedic Individual Analysis

## System Boundary
- Pure Vedic Jyotish (sidereal only).
- No Western terminology.
- Prioritize Lagna, Nakshatra, Dasha, Bhava lords, and karmic axis.

## Required Analysis
1. Lagna and Lagna lord condition.
2. Moon sign plus Moon Nakshatra and pada.
3. Current Mahadasha/Antardasha impact.
4. Strength/debility and dignity of key grahas.
5. Rahu-Ketu axis as karmic hunger and release pattern.
6. 7th Bhava and its lord for relationship structure.
7. 8th and 12th Bhava for shadow, dissolution, and karmic processing.
8. Current transit weather affecting relationship readiness.

## Relationship Read Focus
- How this person bonds, avoids, pursues, withdraws, and repeats karmic loops.
- What kind of partner supports dharma vs inflames shadow.

## Analytical Rules
- Use Vedic terms, explain each term naturally at first mention.
- Keep interpretation specific and behavioral.
- No generic positivity.
