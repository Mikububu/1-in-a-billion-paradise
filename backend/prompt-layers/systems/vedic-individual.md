# Vedic Individual Analysis

## System Boundary
- Jyotish only: sidereal zodiac, Lahiri ayanamsa, whole-sign houses, Vimshottari Dasha, Navamsha (D-9), nakshatras, Vedic drishti, Rahu-Ketu karmic axis.
- Swiss Ephemeris positions are the only valid positional input. Do not invent or approximate placements.
- No Western tropical concepts and no outer planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) as primary significators.
- This is a one-person reading focused on identity, emotional architecture, relationship patterning, and current life chapter.

## Required Calculations (before interpretation)
1. Lagna and Lagna lord: sign, dignity, bhava placement, and condition.
2. Chandra: rashi, bhava, nakshatra, pada, nakshatra lord.
3. All nine grahas (Surya, Chandra, Mangal, Budha, Guru, Shukra, Shani, Rahu, Ketu): longitude, rashi, bhava, dignity, nakshatra, pada.
4. Dignity map: uchcha, neecha, svakshetra, moolatrikona, neutral.
5. Bhava concentration: identify bhavas with three or more grahas.
6. Seventh bhava and seventh lord condition.
7. Eighth bhava placements and rulers.
8. Twelfth bhava placements and rulers.
9. Navamsha (D-9): Navamsha Lagna, Chandra, Shukra, and seventh-lord condition.
10. Vimshottari Dasha: current Mahadasha + Antardasha from Moon nakshatra.
11. Manglik check from Lagna and Moon (houses 1,2,4,7,8,12).

### Transit Scan
- Check current Guru, Shani, Rahu, Ketu, and Mangal against natal grahas and Lagna (within 5 degrees).
- Note current Guru and Shani bhava placements.
- Flag exact conjunctions/oppositions that materially change relationship readiness.

## Interpretation Lens (Vedic-Specific)
- Neecha must be interpreted as transformation pattern, not a deficit label.
- Eighth-bhava signatures indicate capacity for depth and merger; state both power and cost.
- Bhava density/stelliums indicate concentration and pressure zones; describe concrete life impact.
- Rahu-Ketu must be interpreted as karmic hunger vs prior mastery, not generic polarity text.
- Navamsha is mandatory for committed-relationship truth and maturity arc.

## Reading Requirements
Write as ONE continuous essay in plain text.
Do NOT include section headings, numbering, or labeled blocks.

### 1) Natal Engine
- Describe how the person meets life (Lagna + Lagna lord).
- Explain where life pressure concentrates (bhava density, key dignities).

### 2) Emotional Architecture
- Chandra + nakshatra interpretation as behavioral emotional pattern.
- State stress behavior, recovery style, and attachment pattern.

### 3) Love and Bonding Pattern
- Shukra condition, seventh bhava, seventh lord, and relationship expectations.
- State likely mismatch patterns and what actually stabilizes partnership.

### 4) Will, Conflict, and Endurance
- Mangal for action/conflict signature.
- Shani for discipline, burden style, and long-cycle resilience.

### 5) Karmic Axis
- Rahu/Ketu: what is being pursued now vs what is already over-mastered.
- Translate into practical relationship consequences.

### 6) Partnership Maturity (Navamsha)
- Contrast D-1 presentation with D-9 commitment truth.
- State how partnership changes the person over time.

### 7) Current Chapter
- Mahadasha/Antardasha + relevant transits as present chapter logic.
- Explain demands/opportunities of this chapter in concrete relational terms.

### 8) Practical Verdict
- Final prose verdict must include:
  - strongest relational capacity
  - most costly relational pattern
  - what kind of partner is truly compatible
  - what this person must do differently now
- No numeric scoring for individual readings.

## Analytical Rules
- Interpret every major Jyotish finding through real-life behavior, not abstract doctrine.
- Keep claims chart-grounded and specific to placements in this chart.
- Do not dilute difficult findings when chart conditions are materially challenging.
- Do not teach Jyotish or define terms (no “nakshatra is…”, no “Vimshottari means…”). Use the computed factors to predict behavior.

## What This Prompt Does NOT Cover
- Global writing style and delivery rules (see `writing-style-guide.md`).
- Other systems (Hellenistic, Kabbalah, Gene Keys, Human Design).
- Synastry/two-person analysis (see `vedic-synastry.md`).
- Bundle/final-verdict synthesis layer.
- Matchmaking rank engine rules (see `VEDIC_MATCHMAKING_SPEC.md`).
