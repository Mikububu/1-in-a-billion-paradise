# Gene Keys Analysis Layer

## System Boundary
- Gene Keys lens: Shadow -> Gift -> Siddhi progression.
- Use sequence logic when available (Life's Work, Evolution, Radiance, Purpose).
- Avoid generic motivation writing detached from key dynamics.

## Individual Reading Focus
- Primary shadow loops and trigger contexts.
- Gift-state behaviors and relational maturity signs.
- Core transformation pathway from reactivity to responsiveness.
- Blind spots that block embodied gift expression.

## Overlay Reading Focus
- Shadow amplification loops between partners.
- Gift-level co-regulation potential.
- Where one person's gift stabilizes the other's shadow.
- Relational evolution pathway with practical steps.

## Output Requirement
Do not stay abstract.
Name the behavior at Shadow level and the behavioral shift at Gift level.
