# Hellenistic Synastry Analysis

## System Boundary
- Hellenistic astrology framework: sect, essential dignity, cross-aspects, house overlays, profections, nodes, transits.
- Swiss Ephemeris calculated positions are primary input. Do not invent or approximate positions.
- No modern psychological astrology language. No "healing journey." No "growth opportunity" unless the chart demands it.
- This is a two-person relationship reading. Both charts receive equal analytical depth.

## Required Calculations (must be completed BEFORE writing any interpretation)

### For Each Person
1. **Sect determination**: Day chart (Sun above horizon) or Night chart (Sun below horizon).
   - Day chart: Jupiter = sect benefic (strongest ally), Mars = out-of-sect malefic (most dangerous)
   - Night chart: Venus = sect benefic (strongest ally), Saturn = out-of-sect malefic (most dangerous)
2. **Essential dignity of Venus**: Domicile, exaltation, peregrine, detriment, or fall. This determines love capacity.
3. **Essential dignity of Moon**: Same scale. This determines emotional capacity.
4. **Essential dignity of all traditional planets** (Sun through Saturn): Note any planet in domicile, exaltation, detriment, or fall.
5. **House cusps** (Placidus): Identify 1st, 4th, 7th, 8th, 12th house cusps specifically.
6. **Profection year**: Current age modulo 12 from ASC sign. Identify lord of the year. Identify profected 7th house and its ruler.

### Transit Scan (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP)
For each person, check ALL ten transiting planets (Sun through Pluto) against ALL natal points (planets, ASC, MC) within 5 degree orb. Include:
- Conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition
- Note retrograde status
- Flag anything within 1 degree as exact/active
- Check which transiting planets are physically IN the 1st, 4th, 7th, 8th, and 12th houses

**NEVER declare one chart "quiet" without running the full scan.** Inner planet transits (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars) matter on the reading date. The Sun opposing someone's Moon at 0.6 degrees is the loudest transit in their chart that day.

### Cross-Aspect Table
Calculate every aspect between Person A's planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, ASC, MC, Node) and Person B's same points. Orb 3 degrees for hard data, 5 degrees for context. Count hard aspects (square, opposition) vs soft aspects (trine, sextile) vs bonds (conjunction). Report the ratio.

### House Overlays
Place each person's Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn into the other person's house system. Flag:
- Planets in the other's 8th house (obsessive bonds)
- Planets in the other's 12th house (hidden/karmic/blind spot)
- Planets in the other's 7th house (direct partnership)
- Planets in the other's 1st house (identity impact)
- Planets in the other's 4th house (foundation impact)
- Planets in the other's 10th house (public life impact)

### Nodal Analysis (Past Life Indicators)
- Check Person A's North and South Node against all of Person B's planets (orb 5 degrees)
- Check Person B's North and South Node against all of Person A's planets (orb 5 degrees)
- South Node conjunct Venus/Moon = past life love connection
- North Node trine/sextile Mercury/Jupiter = growth direction alignment
- Nodes square personal planets = karmic friction

### Venus-Venus Aspect
Check if their Venus planets aspect each other at all. If no major aspect exists, this must be stated. It means their love languages do not connect directly.

### Same Rising Sign Check
If both have the same rising sign, this is significant: they experience the same transits in the same houses simultaneously. The reading must address this.

## Reading Structure

### Part 1: Who Is Person A (natal portrait)
- Sect: who guards them, who hunts them
- Dominant sign emphasis (stelliums)
- Venus condition (dignity) = how they love
- Moon condition (dignity) = how they feel
- Mars condition = how they fight/act
- ASC = how they attach and defend
- Any natal Neptune/Pluto on angles = dissolution/obsession patterns

### Part 2: Who Is Person B (natal portrait)
- Same structure as Part 1
- Equal depth. Do not give one person more attention than the other.

### Part 3: What The Sky Is Doing To Them Right Now
- Person A's current transit weather. Use the full scan. Miss nothing.
- Person B's current transit weather. Use the full scan. Miss nothing.
- If same rising sign: explicitly state they are in the same storm, same houses, different natal points being hit.
- Describe what each person is experiencing in their body and daily life, not abstractly.
- State which person appears calm from outside but is not. State which person appears cold but is drowning.

### Part 4: If They Cross Paths (Synastry)
- The recognition (ASC connections, first impression)
- The collision (Sun-Sun aspect, identity friction or harmony)
- The bond (strongest soft aspect, the thing that holds it together)
- The grind (dominant hard aspects, how the fights go, what the repetitive pattern is)
- Mars-Saturn cross-aspects = the fight that never changes structure
- Venus condition asymmetry = who can give vs who can measure
- Venus-Venus aspect or lack thereof = whether love languages connect
- House overlays = where they live inside each other (8th house Moon = amputation on separation, 12th house Saturn = invisible enemy, etc.)
- Sexual and emotional depth (Scorpio/8th house/Pluto indicators)

### Part 5: The Karmic Thread
- South Node contacts = past life evidence, what the body remembers
- North Node contacts = growth direction, who teaches whom what
- Node squares = karmic friction, growth colliding with the other's core
- Saturn cross-aspects = karmic debts, lessons that must be learned
- 12th house overlays = unfinished business from before

### Part 6: What Comes Next (no dates, no years)
- Describe coming transits by their quality, not their timestamp
- "There is a period ahead where..." not "In October 2027..."
- Key transits to describe: Saturn testing Venus (love test), Jupiter expanding Venus (love capacity opening), Neptune separating from Moon (fog lifting), Saturn return (restructuring), Uranus in 7th (partnership disruption period)
- Profection year shifts that matter (both entering Mercury years = communication window, Venus year = love activated)
- If a once-in-12-years transit is approaching a key planet, say so without dating it

### Part 7: Compatibility Scores
Rate each dimension 1-10 with a one-paragraph explanation:

1. **Soul Connection**: Nodes, zero-degree contacts, same rising sign, past life indicators
2. **Daily Life Together**: Hard/soft aspect ratio, Sun-Sun aspect, Mercury-Mercury aspect, Venus-Venus contact
3. **Emotional and Sexual Depth**: Moon overlays in 8th, Scorpio/Pluto contacts, fixed water indicators
4. **Growth Potential**: North Node trines/sextiles, Sun-Pluto sextiles, mutual teaching indicators
5. **Danger**: 12th house overlays, Mars-Saturn squares, Venus in fall receiving domicile, sect malefic contacts
6. **Overall**: Weighted average that reflects honest assessment

### Part 8: Verdict
- Does not say "the sky does not say stay or go." The reading must have an opinion.
- States clearly what the relationship requires from each person specifically.
- States what happens if one is willing and the other is not.
- States honestly whether an easier partner exists for each person and what that easier partner would feel like vs what this connection feels like.
- Ends with a final image or question that lands in the body, not the intellect.

## Analytical Rules

1. **Never privilege one chart over the other.** Both people are in weather. Both people are in pain or ease. Check both with equal thoroughness.
2. **Never say "quiet" about any chart without running the full transit scan first.** Inner planets on the reading date matter.
3. **The hard/soft ratio is honest data.** If there are 11 hard aspects and 5 soft, say so. Do not soften the ratio with qualifiers.
4. **Venus-Venus no-aspect must be stated.** If their love planets do not speak to each other, the reading must name this. It is one of the most important findings in any synastry.
5. **Same rising sign = same transit houses.** If both are Scorpio rising, every transit planet sits in the same house for both. This must be stated and its implications explored.
6. **Profection lords matter.** If one person's relationship sector is ruled by Saturn this year, that information changes the entire reading of their partnership experience.
7. **House transits matter as much as natal transits.** Uranus physically sitting in someone's 7th house is the most important relationship indicator regardless of what natal planet it aspects.
8. **Jupiter retrograde in the 8th house** is not "opportunity for deep bonds." It is the expansion of obsessive attachment inward, bonds that cannot release, pressure building with nowhere to go.
9. **Do not use Neptune transits to excuse behavior or create hope.** Neptune on the Moon means the person cannot feel accurately. State this as fact. Do not romanticize it.
10. **The verdict must be honest.** If the charts suggest the relationship will grind both people down, say so. If the charts suggest extraordinary depth alongside extraordinary friction, say both. Do not end with "it is up to you." End with what the reading actually concludes.
