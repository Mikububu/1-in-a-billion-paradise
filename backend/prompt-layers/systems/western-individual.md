# Hellenistic Individual Analysis

## System Boundary
- Hellenistic astrology framework: sect, essential dignity, house rulerships, profections, transits.
- Swiss Ephemeris calculated positions are primary input. Do not invent or approximate positions.
- No modern psychological astrology language. No "healing journey." No "inner child."
- This is a one-person reading. Deep. Specific. About how this person operates in relationships, not in general.

## Required Calculations (must be completed BEFORE writing any interpretation)

### Natal Chart
1. **Sect determination**: Day chart (Sun above horizon) or Night chart (Sun below horizon).
   - Day chart: Jupiter = strongest ally, Mars = most dangerous enemy
   - Night chart: Venus = strongest ally, Saturn = most dangerous enemy
2. **Essential dignity of every traditional planet** (Sun through Saturn):
   - Domicile (own sign, full power)
   - Exaltation (elevated power)
   - Peregrine (no essential dignity, moderate)
   - Detriment (opposite own sign, weakened)
   - Fall (opposite exaltation, weakest)
3. **Venus analysis** (central to relationship reading):
   - Sign, degree, house
   - Dignity status
   - Aspects to other natal planets (orb 5 degrees)
   - House rulership (what house has Taurus or Libra on cusp?)
   - Retrograde status
4. **Moon analysis** (emotional body):
   - Sign, degree, house
   - Dignity status
   - Aspects to other natal planets
   - Phase (waxing/waning, how far from Sun)
5. **Mars analysis** (how they fight, assert, pursue):
   - Sign, degree, house
   - Dignity status
   - Sect status (is Mars the sect malefic? If day chart, Mars is most harmful)
6. **7th house analysis** (partnership):
   - Sign on cusp
   - Ruler of 7th: where is it, what condition is it in, what aspects does it make?
   - Any planets in the 7th house
7. **8th house analysis** (deep bonds, obsession, shared resources):
   - Sign on cusp, ruler, planets present
8. **5th house analysis** (romance, pleasure, attraction):
   - Sign on cusp, ruler, planets present
9. **12th house analysis** (hidden patterns, self-undoing, karma):
   - Sign on cusp, ruler, planets present
10. **ASC and its ruler** (identity, body, how they enter rooms and relationships):
    - Sign, degree
    - Any planets conjunct ASC (especially Neptune, Pluto, Saturn)
    - Ruler of ASC: where is it, what dignity, what aspects
11. **Nodal axis**:
    - North Node sign and house = direction of growth
    - South Node sign and house = karmic past, what comes naturally, what to evolve beyond
    - Any planets conjunct the nodes
12. **Stelliums**: If 3+ planets in one sign, this dominates the personality. Name it. Describe its effect on relationships.

### Profection (Current Year)
- Current age, profected sign, lord of the year
- Profected 7th house sign and ruler (relationship theme this year)
- Profected 5th house sign and ruler (romance theme this year)
- Is the lord of the year in good or bad dignity? This sets the tone.

### Transit Scan (CRITICAL)
Check ALL ten transiting planets (Sun through Pluto) against ALL natal points within 5 degree orb.
- Flag everything within 1 degree as exact/active
- Check which transiting planets are physically IN the 1st, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 12th houses
- Note retrograde status
- **Do not skip inner planets.** The Sun opposing the Moon on the reading date is the loudest transit that day.

## Reading Structure

### Part 1: The Foundation (Sect and Signature)
- Day or night chart and what that means: who helps them, who hurts them
- Dominant sign energy (stelliums, concentration of planets)
- ASC sign and any planets on it = how the world meets them, how they attach
- The overall shape: is this a scattered chart or a concentrated one? Fixed, cardinal, mutable dominance?

### Part 2: How They Love (Venus)
- Venus sign, dignity, house
- What this Venus does well and what it cannot do
- Venus in fall = loves through service/analysis, cannot surrender/receive
- Venus in domicile = loves at full power, gives freely, may overwhelm partners who cannot match
- Venus in detriment = loves in ways that feel wrong to the person doing it
- How Venus aspects Mars (if at all) = internal desire/love integration or conflict
- How Venus aspects Saturn (if at all) = love meeting restriction
- How Venus aspects Neptune (if at all) = love meeting illusion
- What house Venus rules = where love energy flows in the life

### Part 3: How They Feel (Moon)
- Moon sign, dignity, house
- Emotional accuracy: domicile Moon = precise instrument. Fall Moon = unreliable under stress. Etc.
- Moon aspects to Saturn = emotional restriction patterns
- Moon aspects to Neptune = emotional fog patterns
- Moon aspects to Pluto = emotional intensity/obsession patterns
- Moon house placement = where the emotional body lives (8th house Moon = deep bonds, 12th house Moon = hidden emotional life, 4th house Moon = roots and family, 7th house Moon = needs partnership to feel)

### Part 4: How They Fight and Pursue (Mars)
- Mars sign, dignity, house
- Sect status: is Mars the most harmful planet in this chart?
- Mars in Leo = performs conflict, needs audience for anger
- Mars in Scorpio = holds anger, strikes surgically, never forgets
- Mars in Libra = avoids conflict, then explodes
- Mars in Aries = direct, fast, burns hot then done
- Etc. for all signs. Be specific to this person's Mars.
- Mars aspects to Saturn = frustrated action, blocked will
- Mars aspects to Jupiter = overextended action, too much too fast
- What house Mars rules = where the fighting energy activates

### Part 5: How They Partner (7th House)
- Sign on 7th cusp = what kind of partner they attract/need
- Ruler of 7th: its condition determines the quality of partnerships
- 7th ruler in fall or detriment = partnerships are structurally difficult
- 7th ruler in domicile or exaltation = partnerships come naturally
- Planets in 7th = what energy lives in the partnership house
- Saturn in 7th = late partnerships, serious partners, heavy commitments
- Neptune in 7th = idealized partners, deception in partnerships, fog around who the partner actually is
- Uranus in 7th = disrupted partnerships, need for freedom within commitment

### Part 6: The Shadow (12th House, Sect Malefic, Difficult Placements)
- 12th house sign, ruler, planets = what they cannot see about themselves
- Sect malefic's house and aspects = where the most damage happens
- Any planet in fall or detriment = where capacity is weakest
- Saturn aspects to personal planets = where restriction lives
- Pluto aspects to personal planets = where obsession/control lives
- Neptune on angles = boundary dissolution as identity feature

### Part 7: The Karmic Direction (Nodes)
- South Node = what they came here already knowing, the default, the comfortable pattern that may need to be outgrown
- North Node = direction of growth, what feels unfamiliar but necessary
- Planets conjunct nodes = what energy is karmically loaded
- South Node in relationship signs (Libra, 7th house) = relationships are the past pattern
- North Node in identity signs (Aries, 1st house) = independence is the growth direction
- Be specific about what the node axis means for THIS person's love life

### Part 8: Right Now (Current Weather)
- Every active transit, described by its physical and emotional impact
- What house the transiting planets occupy = what life area is under pressure
- Profection lord and its current transit status
- If Neptune/Saturn are hitting Moon or Venus = the emotional/love instrument is compromised. State this clearly.
- If Uranus is in the 7th = partnerships are destabilized. State this clearly.
- If Jupiter is retrograde in the 8th = bonds are expanding inward, cannot release. State this.
- Describe what this person FEELS right now in their body. Not abstractly.

### Part 9: What Kind of Partner They Need vs What They Attract
- Venus sign suggests what they are attracted to
- 7th house sign suggests what they attract/need
- If these two signals conflict (Venus wants one thing, 7th house ruler says another), name the conflict
- What sign/element would trine their Venus = easiest love match
- What sign/element would sextile their Venus = good love match with effort
- What sign/element squares their Venus = friction match
- Be honest: if their Venus is in fall, they need a patient partner who can wait for the window to open. Say so.

### Part 10: Compatibility Scores (Self-Assessment)
Rate each dimension 1-10 with brief explanation:

1. **Emotional Availability**: Moon dignity + current transits to Moon. How accessible is their emotional body right now?
2. **Love Capacity**: Venus dignity + aspects to Venus. How well can they give and receive love?
3. **Partnership Readiness**: 7th house condition + profected 7th ruler + current transits to 7th. Are they structurally ready for partnership right now?
4. **Depth Capacity**: 8th house, Pluto aspects, Scorpio emphasis. How deep can they go?
5. **Danger to Partners**: Sect malefic aspects to Venus/Moon, Mars-Saturn contacts, 12th house planets. What damage do they unconsciously cause?
6. **Growth Direction**: Node axis, North Node aspects. Where is love taking them?

### Part 11: The Verdict
- What this person needs to know about themselves in relationship that they probably do not want to hear.
- What they do that pushes partners away, described behaviorally not abstractly.
- What they do that draws partners in.
- What they are currently unable to do (based on transit weather) that they will be able to do when the weather passes.
- One honest sentence about the kind of partner who would thrive with them and the kind who would be destroyed by them.

## Analytical Rules

1. **Venus dignity is the most important single data point** in a relationship-focused individual reading. It determines love capacity at the most fundamental level.
2. **Run the full transit scan before writing.** Do not assume the chart is calm or active without checking.
3. **Inner planets on the reading date matter.** The Sun opposing the Moon is the loudest transit that day.
4. **House transits matter as much as natal aspects.** Uranus in the 7th house changes everything about the partnership reading regardless of what natal planet it aspects.
5. **The profected 7th house ruler** tells you what planet governs relationships THIS year. If it is Saturn, relationships are under restriction this year. If it is Venus in domicile, love is supported this year. This is not optional information.
6. **Do not romanticize difficult placements.** Venus in fall means the person struggles to receive love. Neptune on the ASC means they lose themselves in others. Saturn in the 7th means partnerships are heavy. Say what the chart says.
7. **Do not pathologize difficult placements either.** Venus in fall is a starting condition, not a diagnosis. Neptune on the ASC creates depth alongside dissolution. Saturn in the 7th creates lasting partnerships alongside heavy ones.
8. **The reading must describe behavior, not concepts.** Not "they may struggle with vulnerability" but "they stand at the window watching the rain. They do not go outside. Their Venus does not have that tool."
9. **The verdict must say something the person does not want to hear.** If it does not make them uncomfortable, it is not honest enough.
