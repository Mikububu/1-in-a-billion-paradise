# Human Design Analysis Layer

## System Boundary
- Human Design as primary system.
- Focus on Type, Strategy, Authority, centers, channels, and gate themes.
- Do not collapse reading into generic astrology language.

## Individual Reading Focus
- Type mechanics in everyday decisions and relationships.
- Strategy violations and resulting frustration/bitterness/anger/disappointment.
- Authority trust vs mind override patterns.
- Defined/undefined center vulnerabilities and strengths.
- Gate/channel themes translated into behavior.

## Overlay Reading Focus
- Auric dynamic between two Types.
- Decision pacing mismatch (Authority compatibility).
- Center conditioning loops and relational triggers.
- Channel complementarity or electromagnetic tension.
- Practical communication and boundary protocols.

## Output Requirement
Always convert system mechanics into concrete behaviors and repair actions.
