# Gene Keys Individual Analysis

## System Boundary
- Gene Keys framework: Shadow, Gift, Siddhi pathways.
- Use Activation sequence as core and relevant Venus/Pearl themes where available.

## Required Analysis
1. Dominant key themes and current Shadow expression.
2. Gift pathway: what behavioral shifts unlock it.
3. Siddhi direction as long-horizon potential, without inflation.
4. Relationship patterns through Shadow/Gift transitions.
5. Practical contemplation path for real behavior change.

## Analytical Rules
- Do not reduce to personality labels.
- Keep the work grounded in concrete daily loops.
- Use Gene Keys terminology precisely.
